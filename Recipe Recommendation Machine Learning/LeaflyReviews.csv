,BD (Blue Dream) Reviews,,
CannabisKook,"Friends, stoners, red-eyed countrymen, lend me your ears; for I bring unto thee a tale of the Blue Dream...  Tâ€™was a calm April night, 2014 it was, and I had eagerly purchased an eighth of some pungent Blue Dream. Itâ€™s abundance of sugary trichomes, paired with the thick density of the bud was enough to bring a tear to your eye. I enthusiastically ground up the cheeba, packed a generous bowl and went to town. Eight minutes and a bowl later, I was beginning to assume that my herb wasnâ€™t all that strongâ€_but then it hit me like a 150-ton locomotive of euphoria.  â€œWhoooaâ€ù was the only thing that I could say, as I looked at everything around the living room. Everything looked as if it were lagging behind by a few frames, and this cerebral adventure lasted for the first few minutesâ€_but just when I thought that Blue Dream had shown me everything there was to experience about her, her sativa effects began to kick in.  All of a sudden, I felt as if I was briskly cruising on a warm cloud, which was followed by an amazing burst of energy. Folks let me tell you, if youâ€™d ever like to find out how an eagle feels when it spreads its majestic wings and takes to the air at 80 mph., this strain is a kickass tool to take you there. Finally, when all of your euphoric energy has been expended, Blue Dream ends her experience with a mellow cruise induced by her indica side.  Call in at Jimmy Johnâ€™s and order 12 sandwiches, fire up Netflix, and take it easy on the couch until you slowly begin to melt into the furniture, because you're going to start to drift off into your happy place; and as soon as you reach that critical point of relaxation, youâ€™re going to sleep like a sloth on twelve doses of Ambien.  Folks, I guess the moral of the story here is that Blue Dream is an outstanding and pleasurable strain that is fun for cannabis enthusiasts anywhere on the experience spectrum; from the novice user who is looking to have an easy-going yet memorable experience, to the seasoned smoker who owns a laser pointer and a cat, and anybody in between; but my review alone canâ€™t depict the exquisite effects that Blue Dream has to offer. Roll up a liberal amount of Blue Dream, spark it up, and let her take you on a spectacular trip; youâ€™ll be thankful you did when your mind is blissfully floating through the heavens.",5,blue-dream
wiseoldman,"I consider this strain perfect for my psychological problems. almost every other weed with this high sativa content seems to cause extreme paranoia but nothing at all like. i felt completely free and loving and more compasionate about myself than i ever have. i have always had an extremely low self esteem and even though i knew that during the experience my depression was lifted enough for me to easily cope with it. I have complex ptds from 25 years of emotional abuse from my mother and neglect from my father. and i felt more relaxed and compassionate about myself any every other person and i knew i had that in there. recomended for anyone that has extreme emotions disturbances about things that happend during your life. not recomended for medical conditions such pchizophrenia obsessive compulsive disorder bi-polasr disorder or anything along thouse lines. not depression though, it eased my depression which had readched a level were i was on suicide watch for 3 years. this strain made my happier and have a more controlled perspective on life while enjoying myself than any other strain ever. deffinately by far my favorite",5,blue-dream
Free_Byrd,"The &quot;Bayer&quot; aspirin of bud that should be in every medicine cabinet. Smoking is slightly blueberry and harsher then expected. Vaporized it's smooth and has a perk up and get er done benefit. Nice well rounded, daytime medication that is not sedating.",5,blue-dream
surfzen88,"So many have reviewed this strain, but I'll add my two cents for medical patients like myself. Blue Dream is Numero Uno. It is the best! Blue Dream is everything I've wanted out of my medical cannabis experience. I'm a sensitive type and I don't like to be high. I have migraines and anxiety for which I want to reduce prescription medication use. BD has allowed me to do that. Honestly, before Blue Dream, I had just about given up on cannabis as medicine because I'd had too many bad experiences from even tiny amounts. To me BD feels like taking a Xanax. It's just mildly-sedating without being panic inducing, and when I vape at the sign of a migraine, it will take it away. Sometimes it takes a few hours, but it almost always works (when it doesn't work, I bring out a bigger gun like Purple Arrow). BD made me realize that clear hybrids might be the best choice to deal with my issues and I've focused on them ever since. Note that the grower makes a huge difference (as always). First time I had it was from a very reputable grower but I guess it was a bad batch because I got no benefit from it. Later i saw Phat Panda had some BD (I've always experienced great product from them) and I tried it - totally different positive experience. After that, I wanted to start stock piling it!",5,blue-dream
HighGradeHealth,Blue Dream is a favorite for my patients who suffer from anxiety or are looking for a way to stay relaxed yet focused while being productive.  Motivated and relaxed.,5,blue-dream
StukaFox,"Not too many people know this, but back during the Stone Age cavemen had hella kind buds! The stuff grew everywhere and it was really potent because it was fertilized   with dinosaur poop. See, they used to feed a Brontosaurus bean and cheese burritos until it was stuffed, then they ran like hell before the deluge hit. The problem    was they only had one pipe and they lost it at a King Crimson concert and smoking out of an apple was way too ghetto. So despite all that great weed, Neanderthal Man   never got to take a giant sucking tornado hit of Caveman Kush. One day, after years of looking fruitlessly for an aluminum can, they all just said 'fuck it' and   died. That's what happened to Neanderthal Man. They never tell you this kinda shit at the museum, but you know how -I- know? Blue Dream. I took a big ol' leather-  lungs hit of Blue Dream and all that stuff came to me like the revealed truth. I also discovered Fritos are yummy and Kyuss is stony. That's THREE Nobel-Level   discoveries off one hit of Blue Dream. Leafly tells me Blue Dream is great for &quot;novice and veteran consumers&quot; but I dunno. After this shit crow-barred open my Third   Eye (not THAT eye, you perv!), I'm pretty sure novice &quot;consumers&quot; might find themselves revealing H.P. Lovecraft-esque truths and go mad, while the veteran   &quot;consumers&quot; point at them and laugh hysterically about what a bunch of lightweights they are. All I know is that I'm all about this Dora the Explorer shit that Blue   Dream engender and so it's time for another hit or three! See you in Oslo!",5,blue-dream
CornBreadCollardGreens,"Incredible strain, especially for wanting to get activities and responsibilities done. It provides a very energetic &amp; alert high that will give you an adventurous demeanor. Two dabs of blue dream cake badder had me cleaning my kitchen and room while listening to some of the finest cannabis friendly music. A great smoke for the person who wants to get out or just get up to get some shit done!",5,blue-dream
BakedBuffalo,"Finally, I've gotten to try Blue Dream. This is a highly touted sativa-dominant hybrid that does not fail to live up to it's hype.  Right off the bat I've got to say, this is one of the best strains I have ever smoked. Absolutely phenomenal in nearly every aspect. Top 5 strain all time for me.  Now, to the characteristics.. The buds were absolutely covered in trichomes inside and out, nice to look at. The smell of this bud is simply amazing, it has a very strong blueberry smell and the taste is similar, but subdued a bit in comparison. The high is simply top notch, where awesome uplifting sativa effects mix with a calm relaxation make this strain one of the best. Medically, this strain is effective against anxiety, depression, and stress; I'm sure there are more, but that's what I use this strain for and it does a great job.  Simply put, If you have a chance to try this strain - do so, you will not be disappointed. Highly recommended. Nearly perfect strain with solid genetics.",5,blue-dream
Mimos,"TL:DR - This is easily the best strain I have ever enjoyed, judging by any metric. I'm not only able to tolerate - but have been able to enjoy Blue Dream. It is the strain that has utterly convinced me that there can indeed be marked differences between strains of the same cannabis subspecies. The effects listed on the Leafly strain info are remarkably accurate. Blue Dream is a good strain for happiness, depression, mood, vigilance, creativity, and those who need to medicate and stay functional.  You want more info after that TL:DR? Here you go:  I stopped smoking pot a long time ago. It must be about 15 years now since I was last able to truly enjoy it. There was a gradual shift from enjoyment to being riddled with anxiety, hellish introspection, and a mental self-flagellation of an uncommonly robust nature, which had begun to make me question if I had some deep-seated masochistic tendencies I had buried and forgot about. Shit sucked.   So I stopped smoking.   Flash forward 15 years, five surgeries, and I find myself recently emerged from a decade's long addiction to fentanyl, hydromorphone, and good ol' trusty heroin when I ran through my Rx before I was supposed to. You can see how pain management might be a tricky issue. I've been experimenting with flower and concentrates over the last year without much consistency in how they work and how I handle it. But there's been enough of a glow in a few experiences to keep me searching for something that will work.  Nearly all I had been smoking and vaping were indicas, or indica-dominant hybrids, since the commonly accepted rule of thumb is that sativas are bad for anxiety, indicas are good. So, I was trying those types over and over again and I absolutely hated it. Many days I would rather be in pain then be high since, not only did I feel worse than before I smoked, but it would absolutely wreck my fucking day.   I had all but given up on finding something that I could use and was weighing the pros and cons of attempting to be responsible with pain management via prescription opioids, again.   On a last-ditch attempt at finding something that would work, I picked up a gram of Blue Dream and one of Tangerine Dream (No intention of keeping a theme, there) and I rolled the dice on a gram of Atomic Northern Lights. after reading the information on, and reviews of, those three.    Blue Dream was the one I had my sights on first.   My tolerance is low. Very low. So I pinched off ~0.05gm and loaded into a one-hitter. As I'm putting the buds back into the jar, I catch myself sticking my nose in it and inhaling deeply, thoroughly, and getting lost in the aroma. A little grassy, a vague hint of the spice cabinet, and a good measure of the nectar-laden flowers of fruit trees. It also has that extra-special something to it that always defines high-quality cannabis for me. If you've ever smelled the stuff they used to import in quantities ranging from the shitload to the fuckton (I think those are imperial units), in addition to medical, you'll know what I'm talking about.  I light the pipe, inhale, hold for ~2 seconds, exhale, and put it away.  The taste of this is really good. I grew up on brick weed though so anything that tastes better than that brown-frown garbage is always a treat for me. However, I'm not particularly fond of the taste of smoke on anything but food. That said, this is pretty good. Smooth. Enjoyable. Nothing to complain about, but nothing I'm going to base a recommendation on, either.  The high itself though, is like, the best shit ever!  The literature says that this is a potent strain, but it's so gentle on the psyche I'm starting to think I can try other strains in the same range and not have a bad experience.  After I exhale, I'll get that initial shift in perception both visually and internally and it begins to build slowly over the next 10-20 minutes from there.  There are mild waves of euphoria and - I feel weird saying all this since I never used to believe it, but it's true - relaxation that wash over you. Real euphoria. Happy, smiling, God-it's-good-to-be-alive type euphoria. In no way do I feel lazy, nor stupid in the head. That is such a drastic departure from everything else I've tried that I almost begin to suspect I've taken on a placebo-effect from reading the reviews.   But I haven't.   I can't quite tell if this gives me energy, or if puts me into the proper mindset to be productive. It doesn't stimulate as much as it give vigilance. Either way, I love it. I no longer feel like a lazy bastard, sleeping and eating Cheetos while giggling at Netflix. Don't get me wrong, I used to love that, and I know a lot of you do, too. I'm not knocking it, I'm just not able to do it and not feel anxiety.   That initial energy and bliss that I get tapers off after the first hour or so to a nice midpoint that feels more like contentment or satisfaction with life, than it does euphoria. Which I actually enjoy. I don't want to be tits-to-the-wind for 6 hours at a time. A good hour of being goofy-level happy is good for me. Any more than that and I start noticing parallels to how I would act under the forceful euphoria of opioids. Nothing bad, just a little more social lubrication than I want for that long a time.  I - completely - agree that this is a good strain for depression, mood, vigilance, creativity, and those who need to medicate and stay functional.  Blue Dream is - truly - enjoyable. While it's not as good on pain as the Tangerine Dream or the ATL I picked up at the same time, it is wonderful in its own way. I don't focus on it, and I'm too damn happy to really give a shit if I hurt, too.  This is the strain which has eased a freight train of anxiety and uncertainty about my medical options in dealing with this aging, broken, body and the possibility of walking straight back into the addiction I worked so hard to escape from.   I will be keeping a supply of this on-hand to reach for whenever I need to be able to function socially, professionally, intellectually, or any other &quot;lly&quot; I'm missing there.   I can't recommend it enough!",5,blue-dream
Tsnky53,"Blue dream is definitely a strain that will quickly make it to your favorites list! With that being said, this strain can be used during both day and night. I noticed that if you smoke a little bit, you'll get more sativa effects and If you smoke a good bit, the indica effects take over. This strain is great for pain, stress/anxiety, appetite issues, sleep issues and much more! No matter how much you smoke, you'll feel great and euphoric! I always have to pick this up when I find some! Great strain 4/5! :)",4,blue-dream
reefmaster44,"Blue dream is a jack of all trades hybrid strain for me. it's everywhere, cheap, tastes good, smells good, looks good and has good effects. the best part is that both indica and sativa effects can be felt. it's not my absolute favorite strain but I will never say no to blue dream!",5,blue-dream
Genevieve_Pearle,"This is the only strain I feel safe vaping before I work. Calmly eases my anxiety and depression without taking any of the sharpness from my mind or distracting me. Makes me feel poised, ready, and confident to take on my day.",5,blue-dream
tjcastello14,"Just an all around incredible high. I love analyzing highs and this was by far my favorite to enjoy and contemplate. This is the most flawless 50/50 hybrid imaginable. You are able to control the high whatever way you like. Helped my anxiety, my depression and my headaches. Best of both indica and sativa. Strongly recommend to anyone :) ",5,blue-dream
rollingman,this weed made me get into an argument with my stuffed animal so yeah I'd recomend it ,5,blue-dream
pecur,I love this strain. GREAT day time hybrid. Makes u feel like u've just scratched a spot on your back that you could not reach for days and it's been itching you like crazy. I am running out of words here to describe how good your whole body and mind feels after medicating with this. The high is on the border of &quot;functioning and couch potato&quot; and you can control it as you want and go either way. Beautiful stuff !!!,5,blue-dream
MigraneousRex,"Love, love, love this strain! Taste is a nice balance of berry and pine, fast and hard hitting, great for migraine relief and a pleasant high recreationally. Hits me almost more like an Indica, and gives me an almost psychedelic high with amazing closed eye visuals. No other strain does that to me.   Also a great horny strain. My god. ",5,blue-dream
joshdecano27,"This strain will wash away your stress and anxiety by sending waves of heat throughout your body. All of your limbs become tingly as if they are all asleep. Your nose and lips become numb and your moth feels like your holding two cotton balls in your cheeks. The room feels like its spinning, but in a good way. Every time you move your head it either feels like your moving in slow motion or high speed. Behind your eyes you can feel a slight pressure, as if your brain is polling your eyes back into your scull. All of the joints in your body begin to fell heavy, pulling you deeper into whatever you are sitting in. Instantly all pain in your body is gone and waves of happiness and relaxation start run through your body. In your head you feel euphoric and uplifted. Your whole body feels locked into place while at the same time energetic. Blue Dream is a great working manâ€™s strain because itâ€™s the perfect balance of sativa and indica. Over all this strain is excellent for stress and depression and everyone should try it at least once.",5,blue-dream
JboneAK,"Recently I've come to grips with having a frustratingly high tolerance, some times struggling to get high. I was no match for Blue Dream. I'm going to attempt to consume and write this, so perhaps the quality of the review is the review itself. See. I'm zoning already.   Visual: Straight off it looks very sativa, with its long hair and slender sexy features. Super sugary and quite sticky when busted open. Well manicured, so tops for aesthetics.   Smell: Opening the bag, it smells like a stinky spicy cheese. Busted the nug and it was super pungent diesel inside. Dank scent for sure.   Now I busted the nug in half and ground it up in my Kannastor and got some super gritty sticky bong load. Loaded a solid pinch in the bowl and lit it with hemp wick. It burned quick and evenly, and had my Silika beaker opaque in about a half second.   Pulled the slide and cleared it. I wasn't ready. I'm looking at my notes now and I very sloppily wrote &quot;holy shit.&quot; I stand by that. Stoned, stunned, stupid. Thick, billowy, diesel flavored clouds of smoke, not too scratchy on holding it in and forgivable on exhale. About five minutes later great euphoria and relaxation dragged it's nails down my back, I just want to sit down, can't cause I got bong rips to do. Next thing I know I'm feeling pumped, focused. Taking notes for science now. Ten minutes since first rip and my arms are heavy as shit, and I'm standing so and can't just lay em on the couch. Gonna have to carry em. Slammed two more bowls. I'm stoned and I'm sitting down.   Blue Dream is definitely going to be a regular for me. ",5,blue-dream
dvianthippy,"perfect...just perfect, highly recommended in the morning with a cup of joe! ",5,blue-dream
vengeurban,"this bud will have you soaring! I've been smoking regularly for 1 year now and when I got this bud I didn't know what strain it was so I loaded my bong bowl FAT. Blue dream is really kiefy so I put a bunch of kief on top of my already bulging bowl. smoking a bowl of &quot;regular&quot; loaded as fat as this one will get me pretty damn high so I thought nothing of it. The smoke was a wee bit harsh and near the end of the bowl I started coughing more frequently. as soon as the bowl was finished I could no longer gauge time accurately and a sense of euphoria came over me. I knew at this point that I was going to be REALLY high for a pretty good amount of time. I laid down on my bed with my chest up and my arms spread out and euphoria just began to wash over me. my body was completely relaxed and my heart rate began to pick up. I've never had good eyesight but now my eyesight was crystal clear. colors seemed richer and the light from the sun shining through my window was just transcendent. since then I've had a lot of spiritual experiences after smoking this bud. this high really lifts my spirits and even long after the obvious effects of being high are no longer felt, the happiness, energy, and a sliver of euphoria are still there. I can't even describe it. just go buy some and smoke it for yourself. hands down the dopest dope I've ever smoked. -Saul Silver",5,blue-dream
afera,"I met the love of my life with this strain and it has been my favorite ever since. Sativa like conversation, aphrodisiac, indica like body high (in higher doses). Amazing taste and perfect all-day strain. ",5,blue-dream
chroniccannabisconsumsr,"Super common strain over here on the east coast, a lot of this strain even gets sold under different names but are textbook examples of blue dream. And its popular for good reason.  The balance between cerebral and body are awesome. Relaxing but not a knock-out punch. Uplifted without anxiety or paranoia. Awesome for mid-day or evening use but not bad for morning either in smaller amounts.  Smells of sweet blueberries with herbal undertones.  Most nugs are big, fluffy, and conical.  The best blue dream ive encountered, however, was solid as a rock.  Either way this is a highly recommendable strain and its easy to see how it became an instant classic.  ",5,blue-dream
Trogdor1597,-----------INTRODUCTION--------- To start this off I'll say this strain is wonderous. So I hit up my dealer asking what he's got and he tells me he has Blue Dream. I quickly  text back that I'll take some but I say it in a way that'll make me seem like I ,5,blue-dream
potprincess2000,"This strain was a staple in Bay Area weed culture in the 2010's. I can't remember who WASN'T smoking it. This is a common but classic strain with strong medicinal and spiritual properties. Recently I've been getting buds with a rich rosey lemon phenotype. It really is one of the most delightful weed scents that I've ever smelled.  Blue Dream is very relaxing and provides an uplifted almost philosophical high. I started pairing this bud with my yoga not too long ago and it really helps to deepen my practice and mind-body connection. Meditation and Blue Dream go hand in hand as well. The reason I'm giving this only 4 stars instead of 5 is because this has a very high THC content and can be very strong, catching you by surprise at times. I've gotten paranoid a few times and in higher doses you can really feel the Haze which isn't always conducive to focusing and getting lots of work done. Follow me on IG @weedtalkmtl for more cannabis culture and content.",4,blue-dream
tvist,"My favorite strain, I use it for my clinical depression and it really helped me feel like a person again. This strain changed my life for the better, if you have depression, anxiety or get easily stressed out I highly reccomend you try this strain.  As this strain helpped me snap out of a really bad deppression cycle that was making life really hard.  I give it a 5/5 :)",5,blue-dream
jkamaya,What can I say about this fantastic strain? Blue Dream is the difinitive strain of everything I would look for. This is uplifting in every way. I am always exuberant throughout smoking a joint with the infamous blue dream. This also can lull me into a nice and perfect slumber. I do recommend everyone to try this! _Ÿ˜ç  ,5,blue-dream
mcwriter,"It's always been a favorite. The sweet/citrusy flavor - which translates REALLY well to BHO, etc. - and the real pleasant fuzziness of the high is just so refreshing. It's like finding a great pale ale or pilsener beer in the middle of an aisle of depressing and humungously-high-alcohol porters or stouts. I can relax and watch tv, or work out in the yard, or go to the store, whatever. Happy and cool. I would recommend it any time you find it. It's resilient too. Even if it's a bit too dry you still get great flavor, not that grassiness I've gotten with (example) Headband (if it's not done right, of course).",5,blue-dream
themermaid805,"Lineage: Super Silver Haze x Blueberry  Blue Dream is said to have been bred originally in Santa Cruz Ca This cut truly shows the Cali blue flavors that just make your mouth water, light and airy with a blueberry splash. One of my personal favorites,  with a sweet berry aroma redolent of its Blueberry parent, Blue Dream delivers swift symptom relief without heavy sedative effects. Nice soaring Sativa with a heavy Indica ground. It's great medicinally for anxiety, Body Pain, Glaucoma, Headaches,depression, nausea, and digestive issues.",4,blue-dream
SomeguyAZ,This is called Platinum Blue Dream and it is awesome. Very good pain management and a pleasantly relaxed feeling.,4,blue-dream
Strainge,"Nice mild high.  Helped cut through my PTSD and anxiety without making me feel like I was tripping balls.  Lovely taste, evocative of mangoes - something I've never encountered in a strain before.",4,blue-dream
EdibleEm,"Today's go-to for a blast and a boost! Enjoyed this one with my coffee and got a punch to get moving through the morning. Good one for fatigue and depression although high thc might make someone burn out quicker if they aren't used to that. No nausea with my pills, moderate direct pain relief, good motivation, good energy. Kinda made me cough, didn't taste as sweet to me as the description says but could be anything including my 40 year old tastes lol It feels like one of those strains that if I smoked too much at once I'd get a headache so for me it's a good one for doing some errands, puffing with a cup of thc Earl Grey for a little rest, and then getting the drive to get back to chores or errands. Maybe also good for getting through a big job- like out here we sometimes have to chop firewood and when you have a lot of pain &amp; mood issues this strain helps me get busy and keep going for quite a while without being tired and grumpy. Dry mouth is an issue, take a water bottle lol I sure do like my sativas :)",4,blue-dream
Always_pearled,"Oh man! This was my very first time smoking blue dream. I had read a lot about it, my friends talked about it a lot, I've heard songs written about it e.g. Jhene Aiko...so let's just say that I was anticipating a really good time. And that was exactly what i got...and more! This strain is soooo relaxing! I had absolutely zero worries. I smoked a blunt of this with a friend, vaped some in my Airis Viva (a vaporizer that i really recommend, you can really taste the flavor out of the bud using this little baking vaporizer) and i was LIT! I'm talking super heady high, high levels of euphoria, creativity...amazing! I might have just found a competitor for my beloved Girlscout.  Negatives? Who am I kidding? I can't think of any! Would highly recommend this strain to all! Absolutely zero paranoia, zero anxiety, just pure fucking joy.",5,blue-dream

craig_DC,"Blue Dream is my go-to strain for my everyday fibromyalgia pain and muscle spasm medicine, it is gentle enough to use very day and throughout the day. It is a nice hybrid, with the muscle spasm easing effects of a indica, and the euphoric, headache easing effects of a Sativa without anxiety effects. I use it when I wake up to get moving, and even use it to help me sleep. I recommend this for muscle spasm issues, depression and anxiety, pain, and other general health issues. Gentle, yet effective.",5,blue-dream
CH33SE,"Suffer from chronic pain, stress, anxiety, etc? Try this strain for a daytime medicine. Suddenly after smoking this beautiful flower, I no longer cared about all those idiots on the news, people fighting over everything, most of all I felt a very smooth ease of ALL stress and anxiety, and suddenly the chronic pain I have to deal with because of the incompetence of a surgeon, was managed successfully!!! Best medicine out there!",5,blue-dream
trixxi,"I finally got to try this strain after hearing so much about it, it did exceed my expectations. It is a hybrid, focused high that came as a creeper that was more of a distracted ... Oh wait, I am REALLY high now. Smoke was sweet without too much flavor; high was enjoyable, lasting and thoughtful. This is a strain for lifting one's spirits and elevating one's mood into a more happy and light hearted stance. Great for after work or when you want to laugh with friends roll a joint of this and pass it around!",5,blue-dream
slug2,Great for enhancing sex and foreplay!,5,blue-dream
paintergirl,"A perfect hybrid.  Can be couch trippy or active and happy.  I find this strain to be very 'steerable', so when I need to change set/setting, this strain works with almost whatever I'm doing and it is my go to strain when I need a little assistance getting my mind and body in the mood for love.  It leaves me with tell-tale stoney face, so I don't use it when I have need to be an incognito partaker.  Blue Dream will lower my eyelids and blow my cover every time.  I can get the munchies with this one, so I have to work to keep that in check.   Blue Dream was my first flower ever smoked and she gave me a beautiful hallucination on that first time.    She'll always be in my favorites and since she was my first, I recommend her to other new newbies as well.",5,blue-dream
HASHTAGHiDef,Great strain all around however it made me lose my remote control for 3 hours causing me to burn to cookies i was baking. Would recommend to anyone with cookies to spare. Also ate an entire roll of toll house cookie dough straight from the fridge and that upset my stomach quite a bit but after more blue dream i was good as new aside from the  raw cookie dough induced diarrhea. Also was out of milk ,5,blue-dream
jjjallen,Bd made me feel like I was a whole person.  Which is a nice way to feel.  The whole point of weed is so you can be yourself and deal with the Nazi's later.  ns,5,blue-dream
clorbager,Wow such a mellow high so calm and relaxing just gives me such the most uplifting relaxation and depression goes away. I feel great :),5,blue-dream
DayTripper7711,"Blue Dream was the 1st strain of cannabis I LEGALLY consumed when I moved to Seattle, WA from the east coast. I had always dreamed (no pun intended) of trying Blue Dream after reading about its Enormous Popularity.  When I finally did get the opportunity to indulge in this heavenly strain needless to say, I was not disappointed. The bud were visually stunning; a plethora of trichomes glisten over the light green colas. The aroma was also utterly intoxicating, an almost sensual mix of spice and berry. The effects aren't typical of strains with sativa heavy genes as it tends to be very relaxing and body oriented with only mild cerebral invigoration.  ",4,blue-dream

JDukart13,"Smoked almost a whole ounce of this strain yesterday with some buddies of mine, had an amazing time. It was crazy how high I was, but still aware of my high and my feelings. I was focused and very able to just communicate with people. Overall amazing strain and would definitely smoke again. ",5,blue-dream
avillax,"What it does: It gives you baby dreamy well-being sensations. You remain clear-headed the whole time, interesting, your field of vision gets a haze like a dream, maybe that's why they call it Blue Dream? It has haze parent so maybe the name haze is because it does give a haze!  The flavor and smell is really blueberry, very nice!  You feel gentle, cute and dreamy like a baby, not really much Sativa energetic feel to it, really, I guess it's sativa influence is only good enough to get you through the day. Very mellow and manageable no matter how much you smoke, def. for newbies.  Good for: Nature, listening to music, anxiety/stress relief, long walks.  What it lacks: It has no energetic, euphoric, speedy, giggly sativa effects.  It doesn't make you horny.  It doesn't give the munchies.  Not an aid for socializing as you feel delicate, gentle, baby like.  Not very introspective.  Didn't make me laugh although many people say it does.  I would generally call this strain Baby hugs, that's how you feel, maybe good for the night but if I just want to feel good for the day and socialize there's nothing like Durban Poison.",3,blue-dream
ajr819,"Blue Dream is the toker's weed. It is not the strongest, not the trippiest, not the drowsiest, not the most social... it isn't super great for any one particular ailment. Blue Dream will boost your mood and relax your body while still allowing you to maintain public normalcy. Blue Dream doesn't MAKE you feel a certain way, it simply allows you to choose how you want to feel at any given moment, and then magnifies it. It is truly a staple to have in the medicine cabinet. Don't take if you are smoking to go to sleep.",5,blue-dream
Camlin,"This Blue Dream was grown by Equinox, a co-op of farm growers in Wa State.  Potency analysis:  THC-A 18.8%  THC .65% Total 20.1% CBD .71%  Method of delivery is Extreme Q vaporizer. I love the blueberry taste left on the lips and aftertaste.  It's very smooth and sweet.  My body felt very relaxed.  The high creeps up on you, very relaxing.  I've got a mountain of stress going on in my life right now and this stuff makes the anxiety go away without making me sleepy.  My neck muscles are starting to uncramp.  I highly recommend this for anxiety, stomach pain, and muscle spasm.",5,blue-dream

deathtojarjar,"Blue Dream is personally one of my favorite strains to smoke.  It makes you feel happy, relaxed, but slightly energetic.  It isn't too overpowering that you can't focus on other things while you have the high, but I personally just like to kick back, watch a movie, and enjoy.  I have also noticed that this strain really does make a person aroused.  It hits you fast.  You could be miles away from being in the mood, then BAM.  I highly recommend this strain.  The high lasts a long while and a little goes a long way, so my supply lasts a lot longer than my other strains.  I sometimes like to mix it with Girl Scout Cookie Hybrid,",5,blue-dream
413SatiVa,Blue dream is a great morning or social strain. It literally gave me energy and made me talkative. I have bad anxiety and almost never want to speak but with this stuff I do. For me though I prefer to more feel my high rather than experience it. It just doesn't get me very &quot;high&quot; it just alters my mood and perception mostly. Good for those lookin for a pick me up or something mild.,4,blue-dream
MarijuanaWriter,"The Farm Craft Cannabis Dispensary  in Boulder Colorado sure knows how to grow! The Blue Dream I smoked from there was not to be cheesy but, it was dreamy. It grabbed me by the booboo with the first puff off my bowl. Being a fan of Kush strains the Blueberry Indica and Haze genetics were a pleasant surprise. A great head and body high all the way around. It would have gotten a 5 but I thought the taste profile could have stood out more but that could just be me. If you get a chance to try some Blue Dream I would recommend it HIGHLY. Blue Dream is Marijuana Writers 420 approved!",4,blue-dream

frogstomp,"Kicked my migraine on this!!!  After 2 Maxalt I was still in enough pain to go to the ER.  The last thing I felt like doing was vaping, now I know to vape as soon as the migraine hits.

rtiqulit,"Blue Dream A.K.A. Blue Berry Dream is one of the most sought after in strains for a reason. The effects provide the feeling of being a sureal dream. There is only a hint of Blueberry in the taste but, the effects of the Blueberry is what truly gives the feeling of physically being inside a dream. The Haze on the other hand is what takes you into this dream with a sharp cerebral high only haze could provide. This Strain is a must try! ",5,blue-dream
bluedream5185,Best strain for depression imo. I couldnt sleep for weeks and my eating decreased to about a half a salad a day.  this blue dream came along and by by depression. ,5,blue-dream
BadmanJ,The high hits u after 2 pulls starts off by just dizzy but then after 10 mins.....BOOM it hits u u feel like your in a cartoon and like everything is slow motion and everything is funny.long high.really reccomended.,5,blue-dream
UDtheAesir,This is a pretty good strain if you don't abuse it. It's a creeper sort that intensifies as time goes on into euphoric and muzzy feel in the head which can last a couple of hours and leaves with a gentle sort of buzz. Toke plenty enough and the experience can take on a sort of psychedelic turn.,4,blue-dream
Indyca500,first timer as well. it was like the first time I had sex...I can't feel a thing....then again I did have mittons on. but seriously I am numb...not a pain in the World. the taste is excellent..beautiful smoke. the inhale is almost oily like a 1980's hash aftertaste. amazing. ,5,blue-dream

gregs01,"In my opinion if someone grows this strain to its full potential nothing beats it.

PoisonIV,"The name speaks for itself; a blueberry smell with a euphoric effect. The sativa dominant form allows for a very talkative experience with a relaxing body high. This combination creates a kind of high is exactly the kind of thing I am looking for. You're not sinking into the couch, and you're paranoid that someone is watching you or judging you. A very relaxing high. Only negatives: dry mouth, and dry eyes",5,blue-dream

trustthetrey,"there is a reason that this is one of the most popular strains. I love the flavor I love the smell, very Berry with the aroma. the high is a very dream like, relaxed and happy high, a perfect high for me. I know that a girl I was with got really bad head aches and seemed to be more paranoid and on edge more so than usual with a indica heavy hybrid",5,blue-dream
VoightKampff,"Productive and Positive. I do like this strain for getting stuff done. On first try, I picked up the house, noticing things I've been putting off for weeks. Also has some great medicinal properties, pains disappeared. I have a strong anxiety reaction with heavy stativa hybrids, and I always keep pushing to see how far I can go without a trip to the ER. I would say this strain allows me to slightly over-do-it without too much consequence. If you're sensitive to anxiety from smoking, this strain may allow you to overindulge a bit. Just try in small doses first. One vendor of this strain was a bit racey and most others have been fairly palpable. - this is a edited review, after I received a second batch. The first one did not sit well with me.",4,blue-dream
konkydong81,"This strain is everything I'm looking for in &quot;day-time&quot; herb! It's incredibly focusing in its effect, and I could see myself doing the wake and bake with this stuff as it's akin to drinking very strong coffee. That would be cost prohibitive, though. I'll continue waking with coffee. The high is totally cerebral (like an energry drink). I noticed no body high at all!        Anyway, this is a superb strain for when you have family/friends/bosses to interact with and need to accomplish things in day-to-day life. This is a great strain for dealing with government offices and authority figures. The normal stipulation on using eye-drops still applies, however. Finally, this strain is very available all over Denver, CO, so if you live here, then you're hooked up adequately.",4,blue-dream
carlsagan,"There is a reason they call it &quot;Blue Dream&quot;, it will have you feeling like you are on cloud nine dreaming with a very sweet tasteful flavor. Blasting you into space, it will catch you by surprise as it envelopes your body  onto a orbital floater device.    Now what I am saying is the classic sativa high without the anxiety is finally here and this portal device is what we call 'Blue Dream'.    The genetics are known as DJ Short's Blueberry crossed with Santa Cruz Haze (Super Silver Haze [phenotype strain] grown in Santa Cruz). It is a legendary clone only strain, only sold as a clone in various dispensaries / clubs and caregivers.    This plant is truly an ultimate value long lasting medicinal effect medication. It can help ease pain with a very strong body high, and it lacks lethargy (fatigue), however it relaxs you aka &quot;chills you out&quot;.    But aswell keeps you awake due to the haze genetics, however you may find yourself able to control the experience if your mind wanders off or not, it is just like &quot;dreaming&quot;. You are in control of the psychoactive effects.  It's a great strain to &quot;Chill out up in the clouds&quot;. But as said early provide strong pain relief.    Most landrace sativas lack a strong body high, and some landrace strains tend to be extremely racy in psychoactive effects, that the average medicinal user may experience Anxiety and or Panic Attacks aswell as intense Paranoia, can be easily mistaken for a &quot;psychotic episode&quot; or schizophrenia.    The landrace sativas should be taken with caution regarding doseage, just as the herb plant may seem light and fluffy, doesn't mean the THC ratio can't pack a surprise. The CBD (cannabinidiol) and other Cannabinoids in the hybrid strains help &quot;level out&quot; the experience.    In that saying Blue Dream is a wonderful hybrid strain with strong sativa dominance but lacking the negatives of the sativa pheno and indica phenos of the Cannabis Sativa plant.    Sativa without the &quot;mental exhaustion&quot; and &quot;psychotic episodes&quot;.  Thanks to the small bits of genetic indica code in both phenotypes, it allows the plant to have CBD to level out any anxiety that may be onset from the Sativa chemical compounds.    if you wish to experience a sativa experience without the negative side effects brought on by landrace sativas, give Blue Dream a chance, newbies beware if you take a large dose.  You will be in for a new plateua of being medicated.    For veterans: You will enjoy this strain in hash form.  For vape users: This strain is a must to try in your collection.  For newbies: Try taking smaller doses of this to get a feel for the sativa and how it effects your experience while under the effects.    Just as anybody says pace yourself when trying new phenotypes.    ",5,blue-dream
crc711,"Blue dream is close to the best strain that I have found for my needs. For depression it is a great strain. It has a nice smooth uplift, with a steady mild euphoria within minutes.      â€¢ Itâ€™s also helpful with anxiety as it allows me to think a bit clearer, and calmer. It helps calm racing thoughts, but doesnâ€™t limit your creativity.   â€¢ A great daytime or nighttime use strain. Wonderful for a mid-day slump to get you back in gear. Also perfect for relaxing at the end of the day.   The taste is amazing, nice flavor with a smooth hit.  Batch info: Curio Wellness in Maryland  (Dispensed by RevolutionReleaf),    [ THCa ]: 23.8%    [ Cbd ] : 0%  --&gt; This stain is high in Terpenes, specifically Myrcene, Pinene, Terpinolene (10.2 mg/g!), Nerolidol, Ocimene, linalool, B-Pinene.      The terpenes in Blue Dream seem to have a nice counter effect to any negative thc effects and give a calmer experience. Generally for myself with thca, anything over 22-23 percent tends to eventually bring on some level of mild anxiety (tighter jaw and a stimulated feeling), but certainly NOT this strain, thanks to its expansive terpene profile. I have found it to be relaxing.      Throughout my experience with Blue Dream, I have found the effects are fast and very effective. I have Depression, Anxiety, and Adhd, so when I find a strain that treats/helps all three simultaneously, like this does, itâ€™s awesome.   Itâ€™s a top-shelf-medical strain that I recommend to beginners and more experienced individuals. I personally have not found a much better strain for depression and panic attacks. Again, highly recommended. If you get a chance to try this please do, and enjoy!     ",5,blue-dream

Vuki63,"Fantastic strain!! Blue Dream is one of my favourite strains. It produces a very relaxed,  euphoric and tingly feeling within a few minutes of vaping. I use marijuana to manage chronic pain and this strain provides good pain relief. It does leave you somewhat functional but it's not a strain I would medicate with during the day when working. I use it in the evenings or on weekends as it does make you feel &quot;stoned.&quot; I don't find any burn out with this strain,  it just gently wears off after about 3 hours. Would definitely recommend Blue Dream for pain relief, relaxation and mood enhancement.",5,blue-dream

I took 6 tokes of the glass bowl and I've been well medicated for over an hour. The smoke goes down smooth and exhales smooth. I'm left feeling wonderful and motivated!

alexsellsout,"The blue dream I smoked was $18 a gram.  I smoked it in a one gram joint because that's my favorite way to test out a strain.  It was an outstanding high.  I was aroused, creative, energetic, euphoric, and focused for a solid hour.  The next hour of this high went quite differently though.  I couldn't resist smiling or laughing.  During the final hour, I became very hungry and quiet.  I had no trouble falling asleep that night.  It suppressed my depression, insomnia, and lack of appetite.  This strain can treat ADD/ADHD, Alzheimer's, Anorexia, Anxiety, and Arthritis.",4,blue-dream
tomfoolery716,"Blue dream gives a very energetic high.  I was beside myself with excitement, ready to move/fly/experience. I felt a tingling in my quadriceps, and suddenly exercising my legs was purely euphoric. I went for a walk outside, then a jog, and then i was sprinting down my street with a huge grin on my face. The feeling was nearly orgasmic,  and lasted for abut an hour and a half. When it subsided i was left with a mildly foggy head, and a sense of simple satisfaction. I recommend Blue Dream for anyone who wants to feel energized, or needs a bit of push or motivation to exercise or knock out some work. Not for anyone who has trouble with insomnia.   ",4,blue-dream

Noca,"Amazing weed with a clear headed high.  It really helps my ADD, I can focus for once and sat through an entire hour and half movie about weed.  Focus with none of the side effects from drugs like Adderall.    It lifted my mood, gave me more energy, relaxed me and caused my depression to pack up it's bags and leave.  More than just not being depressed, I actually feel happy and find life enjoyable even when I'm chronically ill every day, all of this while leaving my sex organs completely functional unlike typical antidepressants (SSRI's).  I found it gave me dry eyes but the dry mouth wasn't bad at all.  No real overwhelming munchies or anxiety, if anything it helped my anxiety, especially my social anxiety and made socializing easier.  It helped a decent amount with my chronic pain as well at lower doses and at higher doses your whole body goes numb to a degree, and pain in your head and the rest of your body is just so much easier to deal with.  At higher doses this strain really helps my asthma as well when vaped, I don't think my lungs have ever worked this good before in my life.  Of the 10 strains of weed I've tried so far Blue Dream works the best for my nausea.   I can safely say that without it my illnesses have got so bad that I would probably have to have a feeding tube by now if not for the nausea control that Blue Dream provides as I wouldn't be able to keep any food down.  I would definitely reccommend this strain to anyone with nausea, pain, depression, ADD, social anxiety or autism.",5,blue-dream

Only drawback for me is that it's hybrid nature means the sativa genes in it keep me a bit too high/alert to fall asleep - not a bed time strain, but great for evening tv/reading/videogame time.",5,blue-dream
KeithVonFraichen,"Location: L'Eagle Services  THC: 18.31 CBD: 0.00  Appearance Rating: 4.50 Appearance Description:  These mint green flowers are very frosty and have countless thick orange red hairs. The buds are healthy size for a sativa dominant strain without being too wispy or too dense.  Taste Rating: 3.50 Taste Description:  I love both blueberry and haze. However, the taste of their cross doesn't impress me. It isn't bad, but it just isn't what I like. It isn't as sweet as the blueberry or as spicy as the haze. The most recent batch I purchased seemed to have a more fruity flavor which is refreshing.   Effects Rating: 4.50 Effects Description:  The effects on this strain are great. They're sativa dominant which is my preference, but I still get some of the effects of the hybrid. This strain has the ability to lift my mood and usually makes me hungry.   Overall Rating: 4.17 (Rounds to 4.00) Overall Summary: I can see why this strain is popular, but it's just not for me. The Blue Dream grown by L'Eagle is some of the best I've seen. My lack of enthusiasm is for the strain itself and not the work of the growers. If you are a fan of this strain, this is the place to get it!  I'm Keith Von Fraichen ...

UrGfsBestfriend,"Taste wise always wonderful, and the hybrid combination is 5 stars ",5,blue-dream
photalysis,"Note: I have a low tolerance. Neutral as far as stimulating or sedating effect goes. Not inherently euphoric or dysphoric, either. Aroma is practically non-existent, good for those who need to be discreet. Highly disorienting in the amounts I smoked, where I would hear voices and music inside the kitchen fan. Colors are very bright, far too high to successfully complete any task requiring &quot;linear&quot; or co-ordinated thought, my thoughts become highly introspective and laterally arranged. Some subtle patterns when I close my eyes. Feelings of intense heat and pressure radiate from my chest. Definitely some potential for paranoia. The experience is very much like a daydream. Has a mild indica end-note that is sufficient for maintaining a sleep schedule, but may not be enough to help with insomnia.  Not great for creative thought during the plateau IMO as cognition is chaotic and incoherent. Unless you take care to write down ideas to be digested in a more sober state of mind.  But by far the greatest effects are those experienced after the high has worn off, after about 8 hours of sleep. A very peaceful morning afterglow in which everyday life has more appeal. I am more motivated, focused and inspired. I suspect either a rebound effect, or a residual high that is therapeutic without being debilitating. I've strategically self-medicated in this manner by getting stoned in the evening, and riding out the tail of the high the morning after. Productivity losses from being too high are more than made up. I recommend it to anyone with depression, anxiety or attention problems. It's something a little more than a &quot;recreational&quot; strain.  In the middle of a small t-break, what the weed gives it also takes back when I abstain. A little depressed, irritable and unfocused. Life is harder. I feel like a part of me is missing... Still much more tolerable than SSRI withdrawals. I sincerely believe this strain is a real competitor to traditional antidepressants. The pros far outweigh the cons, which are few compared to, say, Zoloft.",4,blue-dream
deadsexy,not one of my faves. but I'm not a fan of sativas. This sativa dominant hybrid is sweet and fruity and his smooth but it didn't do much for me. This is definitely one that you can be fully functional on.,2,blue-dream
ccstevek,"I got  blue dream fresh from the grow. I use cannabis for the relief of anxiety and insomnia  and it most certainly worked well for both. However, this is SERIOUSLY STRONG medicine.  I would only recommend using this when on the couch or right before bedtime. I slept for many hours without waking up, but still felt the effect ten to twelve hours later. For me I prefer my cannabis to have a lower THC level than this strain. However, for those with severe pain issues or who have a high tolerance, this is highly recommended. It has a nice balance of Sativa and Indica. Even though it is Sativa dominant it does not make you anxious, unless feeling the effects of strong medicine will make you uncomfortable. ",4,blue-dream

SmokeyTokey0824,"This was my first strain I've ever tried, i remember taking a few fat hits from a blue dream dab pin. And i was like, okay there is no going back by this point, so within like 4 minutes or a little less i felt amazing! i was diagnosed with severe eczema when I was 4 years old, and depression anxiety, that would cause my eczema to flare up and it would be inching and i would scratch because it was extremely itchy, I've tried cream's and certain body washes, and it somewhat helped for a little while, then it started itching really bad again then finally i went to a doctor they gave me some more creams that were &quot;stronger&quot; but it was the same as the other creams I've used, then ever since I started smoking cannabis I've haven't had anxiety depression and my eczema in 6 years, now I'm gonna stick to cannabis and only cannabis, it's crazy that this miracle plant can help so much and of course you gotta have some Blue dream.

I got some pre rolls at NETA and unrolled them.  Takes the whole grinding step right out of it. A great use for joints since quantities are so limited right now.

MsMoon,"REVIEW FOR BLUE DREAM CBD  Iâ€™m leaving this review here because there is no separate listing for CBD. If the regular strain of BD makes you anxious/paranoid but you otherwise enjoy it, the CBD strain may work better for you.  I have been vaping and microdosing this strain as an oil throughout the day. Great for mood, pain and motivation. Typically, it is challenging for me to motivate to leave the house or do even basic household chores. Blue Dream CBD gives me a lift, helps sharpen mental focus and leaves me relaxed. I donâ€™t like to be high in public and this strain lifts me without making me anxious or paranoid when used sparingly. Iâ€™m even able to work using this strain.  ",4,blue-dream
hinkgods,excellent for hanging and playing video games and going out to a movie.. I didn't feel like being 100pct active but the head is calm but creative.. muchies for sure,5,blue-dream
Samadhi82,"I grabbed my first eighth of this tonight from One Love Wellness in Tulsa, OK and, I must say, this may be my new favorite hybrid. All I can say is wow. It's definitely a Sativa dominant with the majority of the effects centered in the head but after a few minutes a warm, almost narcotic, euphoria settles over the body. The vaporized flower has a floral sweetness that tastes incredible on the exhale.   Do yourself a favor and try this if it comes your way.",5,blue-dream
Mesa401,"I just had a few rips on a pen. Very relaxing before sleep, but I like it any time of day too. Music sounds great. My hearing problems get better. I hear better. . Anxiety disappears. ",5,blue-dream
rsgibson,"Great taste and smell, a pleasure to smoke and the flower I had vaped great. There are stronger strains but this is no wimp either. What it does it seems to combine the best qualities of several strains - Has uplift but does not induce a stupor, for example. I found it very good for pain in particular arthritis and muscle pain.  Initial onset is very much sativa. You can keep it that way by spacing out your tokes. But if you wish to go to sleep just increase you rate of intake a bit and off you go to peaceful sleep - Good for insomnia.  This one is in my personal top 5 favorites.",5,blue-dream
StoneyWyre,"As a new smoker, this was an AMAZING strain! I've had Sour Diesel and some no name buds before, but this has definitely been my favorite. I used to be into opiate painkillers and really needed to get away from them. The euphoria was reminiscent of a nice Percocet buzz, so I really enjoyed this. Also, I slept amazing afterwards. I did get the munchies pretty bad, so if you choose to smoke this strain, make sure you have snacks on hand!",5,blue-dream
ithinkabouttrees,"If you are someone like me who already has high anxiety, this strain will more than likely give you panic attacks if you smoke too much. As a regular smoker, I rolled a joint and burned it down while playing Skyrim and didn't think much until I started sweating and hearing my name in the game. I turned the system off thinking I had just gotten overwhelmed, but I continued to get up and try and make some lunch. As soon as I stood up, I got dizzy and shaky. I ended up having to sit back down and drink a glass of water while waiting for the attack to go away, which it did after 20 minutes.  You will get fucked up no doubt. I've never been so messed up in such a short amount of time. But for those of you who don't do well with high energy strains like me, this may be one to sit out on. ",3,blue-dream
rijnsburg,"Blue Dream has been one of my favorites for years. Excellent for use on pain from arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and ansomnia. Creates a nice peaceful relaxing feel, and calms my restless leg symptoms nicely. eases muscle cramps/spasms and gives me a nice appetite. all that makes me less cranky so life feels happier when you're in less pain and can move easier. has a nice pleasant taste and is never harsh. seems to cure well so it burns nicely.

I enjoy this Hybrid because I can still achieve my everyday activities without being to tired or feeling lazy...but still being able to manage my pain levels so i can focus and enjoy work &amp; life.

TheHighMathematician,"Good-tasting strain and a nice, relaxing high. This was the first time I vaped flower (as opposed to smoking it) and I must say that the experience was very smooth. I took around 6 or so draws and felt nothing happen initially. However, the high crept up on me 5-10 minutes later and I went into a state where I felt slightly isolated. I paced around the TV room for a few minutes (feeling like I was in a 5-dimensional space) and then proceeded to watch Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone with my brother. I found some bits funnier than they actually are in the movie, but that's to be expected when stoned. The high began to wear off around halfway into the movie and this made me feel like I just woke up from a relaxing sleep. I then cooked some steaks for dinner. I definitely recommend this strain for beginners as it induces no anxiety or paranoia; just a relaxing experience.",5,blue-dream

From the time I took that first hit to three hits later lol :) I felt a very nice wave come over me.  None of this couch lock stuff, but a really nice body high. I felt focused, no pain, no depression or anxiety.  This is a very nice strain that I will be keeping on hands at all times.  If you want uplifting and a very good body high then you want to try this strain.",5,blue-dream

Jaystun00,Great strain of your life is shit. And currently living with your in laws. And the dad is a uptight white male like Robert deniro in meet the parents. You know the kind that still called weed DOPE!   Anyway I have huge depression hardly ever want to talk and anxiety and ADHD   And let me tell you about my day. I oraganized my inalws WHOLE BASMENT so I can bring my stuff in. And I did it no problem put on some house music.   Than I went to Walmart had a Blast with my wife while getting down on oreros and cracking jokes with randoms.   Asked my father in law to keys to his car to go to the store. He gives me akward look and closes door in my face. I want to ram my face in his ass vigorously with anger.    After smoking blue dream now Iâ€™m chillen in a candle lit room listening to Jhene aiko saying fuck that noise and reading reviews on a strain that should be called gods gift.

fozzybearo,"This is by far my most nostalgic strain of flower, not for its potency; but because of the fond memories from around 2010 when 35$ could get a 1/4 oz from some of the dopest clubs in LA Ca. The market was so saturated in blue dream that winter you could find it anywhere across the city, sadly at the time they shut down half the Clubs across the city over the saturated market and because of how many clubs there were. Every time I ran into it it had the same nostalgia Iâ€™m sure some of you young lungs will love it too. Iâ€™m just happy I can buy it here in Florida.

scientificstoner,"Fellow stoners,   If you are stumbling upon this strain for the very first time or for the first time in awhile, make sure you have no plans for the rest of the day, and depending on the time of your smoke session, possibly the next morning. It is very strong. From what I remember (lol), my first and/or second hits from my bong were smooth, but I still choked a little. That little bit from those hits was enough to make me very high and giggly.   However, as my week went on and I smoked more of my supply (a couple bong loads a day totaling roughly a gram per day) I started to get affected differently. I would get dizzy and nauseated. I would feel really groggy. I could sleep for over seven hours straight (which is great, donâ€™t get me wrong) but when Iâ€™d wake up, I would have a hangover that lasted throughout the day. This is the type of strain that is so strong when used frequently, that it really should be used in moderation.   What I found works for me is alternating which strain I smoke throughout my day. Right now I smoke cookies and cream during the active portion of my day where I want to remain functioning, and blue dream during the relaxation portion of my day where I want to shut down for deep sleep.   Enjoy, but use with caution! ",5,blue-dream
Okayiwillaskalice,"This strain slowed down time, dude. (I aged five years just writing that last sentence). There is high, and then there is Blue Dream high. I have reached the later (Why are Ladder and later so similar sounding? They are like cousins. Later needs an I. I mean: â€œlaitior.â€ù That would be cool.â€ù) Damn, dude. I am a every every day smoker. So, I can handle my buzz. So, it is saying something that this  stuff has lit me up!  I certainly have the brain thing going that I get with a good Sativa. However, I got all the feels of a fine Indica. It had an earthy flavor (like a dawg variety). Yet, the pine and funk that made my eyebrow rise a bit. â€œHmmm. Interesting,â€ù I said.  So, yada-yada. I am a half jar into some crunchy peanut butter, and I just had an idea that would solve global warming. I would share, but I am sure someone is watching me type this.   Wait! It is just my dog. If he could talk, he would tell you to buy some Blue Dream.   Hey, medicinal users! You guys may like this for depression or fatigue. You may also want to use it before  making a really big life decision. I mean, this stuff will give you some amazing new insights.   So enjoy some blue dream! This is some noice bud, Yo.",5,blue-dream
Lens240,This was the strain by big brother grew before he passed RIP. Let me start off by saying this was the strain that got me into smoking.

Tastes great and doesn't leave my breath as funky lol. Highly recommended for new comers.,5,blue-dream
AlteredFrequency,"This strain is an absolute dream. It's topped my previous favourites, White Widow &amp; Jack Herer. Like Jack Herer, it's prone to P deficiency and leaf curling if there's an imbalance in the soil, but it doesn't hold this plant back. Even a relative novice can get her to produce giant, delicious, tightly packed buds under less than perfect conditions.   The high is beautiful - clear headed, uplifted and relaxed without a trace of the anxiety other strains can produce. It's sativa enough to give me much needed energy on my worst chronic fatigue days, yet indica enough to relax my tight muscles. It sits beautifully in the middle and I can't think of a condition it wouldn't help with.",5,blue-dream

I had purchased a lid in Calgary prior to growing this strain and seeing Snoop Dogg concert not realizing he had his own strain(which is a hybrid of this strain)! Very smooth smoke and a mellow high. Very suitable for an indoor grow. Grows quite tall!Pungent smell, with a fruity hint!  Quite easily propagated (cloned) ",5,blue-dream

TacoWifey,Wow. This is a strain with so many layers levels and timing. Anyone with depression- anxiety- social disorder- brain fog- low energy- low libido- GET THIS! This is so healing for mood and mental health patients but itâ€™s not over powering - it has anti inflammatory and anti pain properties again not overwhelming - so you can function on this for work. Itâ€™s extremely Euphoric! I need strains that have those terps and properties and this does it every time for me. Iâ€™m not locked zoned or overly focused like some sometimes can do. Funny thing is if you smoke too much- due to blueberry factor - it will have a creep effect. Some is intense if you smoke a big bowl thinking it ainâ€™t shit but yeah it is. 20 minutes later Iâ€™m laughing my ass off tingly numb which that hybrid plays so careful ! Anyone else recommend Euphoric like this hollar below ,5,blue-dream
5aeid,"I usually don't review strains, or anything for that matter... but this is easily one of the best strains. I'm surprised there aren't any more reviews. I have tried the infamous Blue Dream, which is very popular, but I know that some people feel a little paranoia with Blue Dream... whereas the same people who reacted negatively towards Blue Dream, react positively to Wappa.  I reacted positively towards Blue Dream, but I prefer Wappa. The difference between them is that Wappa has one climax, whereas Blue Dream seems to have multiple. What I mean by that is that Wappa's high is like a great comedy movie, whereas Blue Dream is like a great comedy tv series. I hope that makes sense (I just realized I could copy and paste this review under Blue Dream too).  Summary: Give Wappa a try, you will NOT be disappointed. I personally felt my pains disappear with Wappa and Blue Dream.",5,blue-dream

CannaEyeHelpYou,"What is there to say that over 12,000 people reviewing this strain haven't said already? A favorite of newcomers and veteran consumers alike. Sometimes more berry forward, sometimes more haze sharpness in the aroma, a mild smoke with nothing remarkable or terrible to speak of. Blue Dream always seems to do the trick. A nice even buzz with minimal negative effects, dreamy yet focused a go to for many consumers. Even a 'bad' batch of Blue Dream seems to turn out somehow...mediocre.

HerbeHeureuse,"I picked up the very last of the cheap Blue DreamÂ today at the Oregon Grown Gift Shop this morning, $70 for 3/4 of an ounce.Â  It tested at 27.08% THC and .16% CBD.Â  Â The nugs are tight, dense, fragrant, and are from an indoor grow last October.  I haven't had Blue Dream in flower in a long time, and oh how I have missed it!Â  It was some of the bud I first bought when weed became legal in Oregon.   Blue Dream is a sativa dominant hybrid, but acts like a pure sativa on me.Â  It puts me in a lofty, airy, summer sky head space.Â  I feel electric when I smoke Blue Dream, little splifts of currents skip along the neuropathways in my brain and tickle the cranium along the way; the sparkling blueberry taste bubbles up sparkles in the brain.Â   I'm listening to some EDM on Mixcloud and I feel I'm traveling along with the music.Â  I should do something productive like clean the house but instead I'm just melding with music, riding that blue dream.",5,blue-dream

Holly_Hepcat,"Strain: Lucid Blue from Natureâ€™s Medicines  Consumption Method: Vaporized @ 392 degrees  Appearance: 4/5   The nugs are dense, marbled blue-green, and super sugary, with reddish orange to red pistils. Exactly what you would expect from a Blue Dream cut.   Nose: 3/5   The smell is a bit indelicate, with a hard hitting pine on the front end, which on a second sniff mellows to a pithy lemon and the lightest hint of blueberries on the back end.   Flavor: 4/5   Lucid blue packs a big citrus wallop on the front end. Once you get past that hint of bitter pith youâ€™re rewarded with a sweet, tannic blueberry, and a whisper of violets on the exhale. Iâ€™d compare the flavor profile to a good RosÃ¨ wine.   Experience: 3/5   Iâ€™ll be honest, Iâ€™m not a fan of most modern Sativas and Sativa dominant hybrids. They tend to feel speedy and get me lost in my head in a way that strains like Acapulco Gold and Maui Wowie just donâ€™t. With that said, I really enjoy Lucid Blue! Itâ€™s mellow and clear headed, and I can put my thoughts in order.  Iâ€™m fairly convinced that this strain has Headband genetics somewhere in its past, because it gives me that same perfect head pressure Iâ€™ve come to associate with Humbolt county indicas.  On the whole Iâ€™m relaxed, happy, completely out of it pain, and ready to get some work done.  Overall: 3.5/5   Lucid blue is a delicious strain and a great every day smoke but it wonâ€™t exactly having you wax philosophical about the Bigger Luke Theory.   Itâ€™s restoring my faith in modern sativas, but when it comes down to a straight choice, Iâ€™ll pick Acapulco Gold every time. ",4,blue-dream

Blue Dream made it's appearance, and suddenly chemotherapy wasn't so horrific anymore.   Nausea relief without wanting to eat everything in sight? Yup. I could eat, but I didn't have that insane munchies situation other strains gave me. Pain? Dulled to a point where it was hardly noticeable. The relief was nearly instant (vaping), and I actually had a friend who helped me up into my apartment, packed my vape, and helped me smoke, while I was too weak to leave the bathroom. (Literally had to be carried.)   Get relief, feel content, then drift off into sleep if you choose to. You can smoke enough to feel high, but it's a really peaceful high. It doesn't hit you and couch lock you like other strains tend to do. By far my favorite strain for helping with my chronic illnesses.",5,blue-dream
GreatScott2115,Had this in pre-roll less than an hour ago.  This strain is incredible.  A nice and balanced cerebral/body high.  Carried on a 15 minute conversation with my cat and then went to get something to snack on.  Sucking on a piece of Lindt 90% Cacao after smoking this and it's almost orgasmic.  Can add creative to the effects because I revised this review like 7 times before I submitted it.,5,blue-dream

jack123,"This is a fairly odd strain to review. Its almost like reviewing 3 separate strains at once, because u get 3 very different effects. After smoking u get sativa like effects for about half an hour to 45 minutes. This is the good part of the high (for me at least). After that you &quot;hit a wall&quot; and feel very very tired. Its hard to keep your eyes open. If you are trying to stay productive, this is NOT the strain for you. After waking up, your voice will sound like someone who has smoked 4 packs of cigarettes for the past 60 years... not pretty. Your mouth and throat will feel like the desert as well. Your eyes look like red road maps and you get a &quot;hung over feeling&quot;. I might have gotten a bad batch, because everyone else seems to love it. Its a good strain for about an hour before bed. It was very good for managing pain and anxiety/stress. Also, If you are trying to hide the fact that you are high (from bosses, parents, professors, etc) this probably isn't the strain for you. I love this strain for the first hour, but afterwards it goes downhill. I suggest looking into a really strong sativa to keep you going, because you WILL fall asleep from this.  -Cheers",3,blue-dream
TCMcGregory,This is what we call a rather glorious weed. It makes me feel like a wee little lad again. You just can't do wrong with the Blue Dream. ,4,blue-dream
Ballzley,"Your classic sativa hybrid.  Bright green nugs were about 80% concealed in yellow and orange hairs, very visually appealing greenhouse grown! Euphoric, happy, dreamy with just a hint of energy - good for creative activities.  Some audio-hallucinations, good for listening to music and cruising.  Some body numbness,  but maybe not choice for pain.  Anti-depressive, anti-anxiety.",4,blue-dream

Vaped flower on a warm summer night....perfect pairing with a beer and low key evening. 5 times and I was pleasantly floating on a cushion of bliss. _Ÿ˜œ. Wonderfully relaxing a pleasant body high.... just enough giggles to binge watch a comedy or hang with friends. Highly highly recommended. B Had on the lookout for this strain for awhile.

The packed bushy buds were hunter green with short milky hairs &amp; crystal trichomes. Sunset orange pistils pop out from the buds. The high made me happy &amp; uplifted followed by being calm &amp; mellow. My favorite part of Blue Dream is the smell &amp; taste, a sugary blueberry &amp; sweet berry. The only thing that stops me from smelling it is the thought of tasting it, mouth watering indeed! Budlious :)",5,blue-dream

Michalc,"Tried this when visiting Canada recently, and found it delightful. The flavour and smell are very unique and pleasant, and gives  one of the most comfortable highs I've experienced having tried many strains in the past. It was it overly cerebral or heavy on the body- just a perfect balance that allows you to function like a normal human being still. It also stimulates creativity and is one of the few strains that truly feels like it lifts my mood noticeably. This would be perfect for someone who works creatively or just anyone who wants to loosen up without the overwhelming effects some strains bring.  Definitely one of my favourites, especially for an all-rounder. If I were to pick just one strain to smoke for the rest of my life, this would likely be it.",5,blue-dream

I always make it a point to pick some up when my local spot has it in stock. I cannot recommend it enough. Enjoy!,5,blue-dream
petenadolski2112,"Just the perfect strain right here. I am prone to anxiety from cannabis pretty easily, so I never know for sure what will happen going into a strain. Blue dream is the real deal though. I can vape more of this flower and feel quite lifted, but still calm and totally enjoy the experience. Very, very rarely do I come across something this good. The high is absolutely perfect. It makes sense why this strain has hit its legendary status. ",5,blue-dream
MrUnicorn,"I am VERY sensitive to weed.  I was in a pinch and all my go to strains were not available.  Blue Dream is very common so I figured I would try it out.  I was beyond blown away and now understand why it's one of the most popular strains!  I smoke because I am bipolar.  I have crushing depression and a mind that overthinks.  I mainly smoke indica because I typically have nothing but terrible trips on stativa.  Everything from losing my mind to throwing up.  But this strain is life changing.  You get a nice body high like you would with indica.  But how happy you feel on Blue Dream....it's wonderful.  I feel creative but at the same time my thoughts are locked in a perimeter so they can't wonder too far.  It also allows me to feel and function normal.  You can go to sleep, watch tv, take a walk, be in a social setting or even have sex (this strain for sure enhances the experience!).  My new go to strain for every occasion.  Whoever made this strain....you are a hero.",5,blue-dream
GGx3,"Although this is a sativa dominant strain, it was still calming and didn't keep me awake at night. However, it didn't dull my joint pain  to the level of the CBD shark. Since my pain intensifies at bedtime, blue dream is not what I would use for pain relief at night.",4,blue-dream

DJohnGuinness,"I suffer from PTSD with anxiety so bad, I'm borderline homebound most times. Blue Dream makes it possible for me to go out with friends and feel like my old self for a few hours.   Far from the foggy muddling buzz of other strains, Blue Dream is a clear headed grounding companion with the power to absolutely ANNIHILATE my absolutely crippling anxiety like nothing else while still leaving me lucid and relaxed.   Add this one to your arsenal, gang. You won't be disappointed.",5,blue-dream
NetRaven,"Bluetiful Dream for my needs. Anxiety, depression, pain, tension ease away quickly on this sativa hybrid. I'm glad this is common in my area. Great to function with or chill and daydream.

SebadohGPB,"I was at the skatepark and I met someone who bought some blue dream from a dispensary. He rolled me a small joint. Just about enough to finish in about two or three long hits. It tasted fruity and I was on my way to my friends house and I had to walk a good 2 miles to get there. I couldnâ€™t skate because I was too stoned and this was right around the time I was introduced to bud for the first time by one of my friends. So I was pretty baked. The walk felt like it took a lot longer than it should have. I got there and I sat down and the high lingered for the rest of the day. It made me feel very heavy and I felt like people were watching me. Iâ€™ve felt this with other strains but rarely this bad. Once I was in a comfortable situation I felt a lot better. I felt relieved and happy. Like I just completed a journey. This strain made me feel like I was walking with shackles or a heavy backpack from what I can remember. It was unpleasant when I was uncomfortable and I was happy when I was comfortable. But it was an amazing experience to look back on because of the relieve I felt after I got to his house. I would do it again, in the same situation. It added meaning and purpose to the high. The high wasnâ€™t as significant as any of my other times but it was still interesting. ",2,blue-dream

worldofsimulacra,"The THC effect in this strain does seem to be very subdued and gentle, despite the high level (21%) in the buds I purchased. As a lightweight, I expected a couple tokes to do me in as is almost always the case with higher-THC strains; but I was pleasantly surprised to find how easy and mellow this high is. No hints of paranoia, very safe, calm, and overall just extremely nice feelings both body and mind. Easy to focus and stay active on it, doesn't distract too much, and the level of mental detachment is just perfect imo. The Blueberry flavor, one of my favorites, comes through nicely and that Blueberry mellowness underscores the mental clarity and invigoration from the sativa side.",5,blue-dream
Puffaluppagus,"Disclaimer: I'm not usually a sativa smoker, so if you prefer sativas, this review probably won't mean much to you. For curious smokers, be aware that BD is VERY potent stuff--up to 26% THC. It gives you a strong head-heavy feeling, and like most sativas, it's a &quot;cerebral&quot; high. Personally, I prefer indica hybrids, especially high CBD stuff to treat my anxiety disorder, and if you have trouble with anxiety attacks and high-THC strains, I advise you to look elsewhere. BD is a sativa-heavy hybrid that has a delicious aroma and taste (fruity and sweet), but it's not for beginners or nervous types. If you're experienced and have a high tolerance for sativas, BD is just what the doctor ordered.   But if you prefer a mellow body high without your thoughts and heart racing, BD isn't your lady. And like many sativas (at least for me), be prepared for bit of potential headache or dizziness too (sativas can do that sometimes). Friends of mine who love BD feel creative, energized, talkative, and sometimes aren't able to sit still for awhile. They also say it's good for feeling uplifted out of depression and can help stop you from feeling sad (if you can handle sativa's energy).   For me, I need a strain that slows down my thoughts so I can examine them calmly and deal with things that make me feel anxious (without getting a panic attack), as well as cannabis that relaxes my body and eases my daily tension, so stuff like BD isn't really up my alley. If you're like me, and you're looking for a strain that'll melt you into the couch and carry you away on cool clouds of smoke, go with an indica or heavy-indica hybrid and not BD.  Blue Dream is also a ladies' favorite, as many believe this strain is excellent for treating PMS and menstrual cramps (both the mood swings and the pain), as well as providing pain relief for migraines (most migraine sufferers are women).   For a sweet, fruity taste and aroma in something less powerful, I suggest Sweet Pea (about 1-2% THC and 18-20% CBD), Cannatonic, or Critical Cure (both between 3-6% THC and about 15-20% CBD). All three are indica-leaning hybrids that give a relaxing body stone with a healthy dose of CBD to keep things calm and relaxed. If strong weed makes you nervous, do yourself a fave and skip Blue Dream. She's gorgeous and smells amazing, but she's anything but a wilting flower...in fact, she's the cannabis equivalent of a Viking shieldmaiden, strong and powerful and ready to kick your ass if you aren't prepared  ;)",3,blue-dream

I smoke it with people who tell me it effects them the same way so I can say with confidence, through experience, that this strain is fantastic.

In fact more so than maybe I should and have done of most other things.  I read the rave reviews and couldnâ€™t wait to get some.   Well I can tell you I feel pretty darn good right now. Iâ€™ve taken one hit and itâ€™s about 15/20 minutes later maybe but my body started to feel pretty good after just a few minutes.  I do feel really good. There is a warm tingle to my body. I can feel the muscles that are tight after my gym session today. Itâ€™s not an uncomfortable feeling, itâ€™s feels warmer than the rest of my body though. I do feel happy, relaxed and not at all stuck to a couch. I do not feel sleepy but Iâ€™m not full of energy either. It feels like I have a choice which way I choose to go right now and that just feels great. So does everything to be fair haha.  I would buy this again if it was about and I will happily get through this gram. I canâ€™t really say much more about it as itâ€™s my first time trying this strain. Iâ€™m just going to sit back and enjoy the ride.   Laters _Ÿ™‹_Ÿè»â€çâ™‚ï¸è.  Iâ€™ve been smoking for just over a year now. I mix between vape and bud.

HonEBZ,"the first strain I've ever tried was Boaty Mcboatface which is CBD heavy and light on the THC. that gave a functional high. I could walk, think, and talk straight but it did have a light relaxing and calming effect that helped to reduce pain. I can compare it to a mild caffeine buzz.   my second experience with cannabis was Blue Dream. I vaped it and let me tell you what. within two minutes my body felt heavy (almost paralyzed), eyes droopy, I couldn't keep one coherent thought in my head for more than 30 seconds. I could hear my own heart beating loudly. It was intense and I definitely could not function so I went to bed. It was an unexpected trip. my first 3 or 4 draws on my vape I thought nothing was happening.  Then out of nowhere, I felt like gravity turned up and I was heavier. I wanted to take another draw but my hand felt like it was too heavy to move. The experience was definitely different from a CBD heavy THC light strain. I'm a lightweight when it comes to alcohol and I'm definitely a lightweight when it comes to this strain. my first experience was fun but terrifying. Oh, and Blue Dream did a better job at pain management than the CBD strain I tried first but I guess tripping balls can be a great distraction from pain.",4,blue-dream

k7k7,"One of my fav hang out strains. Uplighting, happy, but not anxious. Great for weekend fun or day time if thatâ€™s your thing. ",5,blue-dream
Chronasaurus-rex,"this is an old school strain that when grown properly can grace the top shelf of any dispensary. they say it's for beginner's but it's also for productive people who like to accomplish things with their day.it will taste delish when grown right but, smell like old hay when grown poorly. it can't hurt to always have a little blue dream in your jar.

Hippysoulrider,One of my favorites itâ€™s great for doing chores around the house!!,5,blue-dream
Dystopialloon,"First time trying this strain and it is a happy weed. Good energy, so calm, great mood. Definitely a new favorite daytime medicine.",5,blue-dream
Weedlizard0706,"All time favorite strain, delicious in any form. This bud was $30 an oz at my local shop which is cheap! Especially for a rating of 20.7% thc. Always a pleasant taste, lots of euphoria, happiness, and energy. ",5,blue-dream

Inygma,"Far more diesel than I anticipated, a bit harsh, but impactful and cerebral strain",5,blue-dream
ArikMalakh,"Purchased a gram of this in the form of a West Coast Vape Co. Oil Cartridge from Dispo on Demand in Phoenix, AZ and the smell is incredibly overpowering, initially the scent evades oneâ€™s memory like some sort of scented candle or artisanal soap. Due to its Blueberry x Haze heritage it boasts a crisp and tangy oil that when vaporized, overwhelms and invades your senses with memories of different smells and their associated experiences. All this only adds to the intensity of the experience as you lose yourself in the bedsheets of time and your own memory.   Highly recommend, and plan to purchase again!",5,blue-dream
Sloppysundance,"I give this strain a B+... it tastes GREAT! Great for creativity... but it also gave me bad dreams every time I smoked it before bed. It only happens with this strain, but it happens every time... maybe a fluke... Iâ€™m just saying.",3,blue-dream
Donkeydabs,Superb. I never use that word. This strain is legit. Kncocks depression to the point when I'm not medicated I'm still not depressed. Perfect daytime junt. Gets me in the Grove when I'm making beats or melodies and video planning. Thank you Jesus and Cali for Blue Dream. ,5,blue-dream
ders19,"Personally, this is the greatest strain of them all. I like a fun but relaxed high and this gives you exactly that. Calms my anxiety better than my actual medication does. Seriously, best and most consistent strain of weed Iâ€™ve ever smoked/vaped/etc.",5,blue-dream
Individunation,"If I could only buy just one, this would be my Grail!",5,blue-dream
Grannifish,Overall so far it's one of my favorite's,5,blue-dream
BallUpStargirl,"I think this strain is amazing and it will alwsys be my top 5 strains. It's very smooth, its the opposite from harsher strains I've tried in the past. This stain is perfect for social events and occasional social settings where you want to feel less anxious and chill. The high you get from this is extremely eurphoric. I recommend it to everyone, first time users included.",5,blue-dream
RaiiChu,Â«Â Brightening peopleâ€™s dayÂ Â»,5,blue-dream
Apaullo63,This has just become my favorite morning sativa. The initial high is clean and without the paranoia and anxieties I usually get from sativa dominant strain. It leaves the mind clear and focused. Not a real strong high but I prefer that when work needs to get done. Enjoy!,5,blue-dream
Killakayjay,"Tried this strain last year when i was in Cali, bought it in concentrate form! Got a free pre roll of it yesterday and was reminded of why this strain is so popular! The taste, the smell, the effects all A1!! I love that i can still function after taking a few hits, doesnâ€™t give a â€œstuckâ€ù feeling which i prefer just for nighttime use. Makes me feel super happy and calm! Def grabbing more of this at my next trip to the dispensary! ",5,blue-dream

ArvadaFlyGirl,"Excellent head buzz; happy, no paranoia",5,blue-dream
MsGootz,"This is my new favorite strain. I have the Blue Dream budder pros cartridge (high the/low cbd) for my vaporizer pen that I purchased at verdes. When me and my boyfriend hit my pen with the Blue Dream we didnâ€™t say a word to each other for a full 30 minutes and just drove around in complete silence enjoying the Christmas lights and scenery. When the initial potency wore off a bit (it hits you in little waves) we both looked at each other and began laughing hysterically. I couldnâ€™t fully form my words because I was so relaxed and still a bit zoned out and giggly. My boyfriend so eloquently put it, (in a Samuel L Jackson voice) â€œBlue Dream, itâ€™ll make you shut the f*ck up!â€ù After I could breathe again and wiped my tears, I just said...â€ùmy love, where did we just go?â€ù From a pain standpoint, I have multiple sclerosis and muscle spasms in my calfâ€™s and thighs and my legs make me fall and this is the first cartridge to fully relax me below my waist and make me melt into my bed at night and work more like an indica. Itâ€™s fabulous for pain and sleep and migraines as my brain is covered in lesions and plaques and I have chronic migraines. I recommend for anyone with the same and suffering from those conditions and nausea as well and chronic vomiting. Will be purchasing this every time I go to verdes. Itâ€™s fabulous!",5,blue-dream
joieme,I have migraines and this is the ONLY one thatâ€™s Iâ€™ve found that actually takes it away. ,5,blue-dream
MorePotPlease,Burns fast but very smooth. Definitely a lazy feeling. Just want to lay down and chill. No munchies. Very good ,5,blue-dream
Bmoresinister,"Love this strain! Smells great, burns well (faster), tastes pretty good. Super nice head high with some calming body effects. Definitely helps with mood. Definitely one of my favs.",5,blue-dream
RockerGirl71,"My first couple of reviews I was trying to format them like I see others but I have decided that as a relatively novice smoker (vaper) I am going to use this as a way to keep track of my opinions on the strains I have been trying.  I mainly use indica and indica heavy hybrids for my insomnia. This was purchased for my husband since he likes sativa more. Since I am on vacation I tried it and was pleasantly surprised. It didnâ€™t hit me hard but rather crept up on me and didnâ€™t glue me to the couch. I could still manage to be productive (and a wee bit chatty with a touch of over sharing). If I move from bedtime use only to more social usage, this might be my go to.",4,blue-dream
Kingjojo535,Sensational..,5,blue-dream
stonerserpent17,"Blue Dream is a really good strain for anyone who is looking for a good cerebral high accompanied by an electric relaxation. With its nugs being a pretty hue of light green and really nice crystals, it an eye catcher for sure. Ive used this strain on a moderate to hard hike and it was AMAZING. I found myself in the moment with this super awareness but still had that relaxing stony feel that we all enjoy. Lives up to its name, no doubt about that.",5,blue-dream
VictoriaJasmine97,Probably my absolute favorite (especially in flower form- I find that it works best for my anxiety and migraines the fastest if I smoke flower) ,5,blue-dream
SmugTommy,"This was the first time I used cannabis, I didn't use flower, I just jumped straight to wax with my friend, the potency of the wax was between 80% to 90% and oh my God, I took one hit off my friend's dab pen and I was soaring, I felt like I was walking on clouds, colors were enhanced and my overall mood was uplifted. Needless to say it made my day. I tried it again later that same day and I picked up on all the fruit y notes of this strain. Overall just a fantastic strain of cannabis.",5,blue-dream
420.Mason.420,I get so high after a little bit and it makes me feel so relaxed. It helps a lot with stress.,3,blue-dream
marsthehermit,"if youâ€™re smoking for relief of stress from the outside world, and want a perfect balance of indica and sativa effects blue dream is the perfect strain for you. itâ€™s sativa qualities gifted me subtle psychedelic effects that enhanced the colour of my surroundings, while the indica embraced me into a comfortable state of relaxation. I find after smoking this strain and finding myself in a mediative state i can literally see blue hues from this strain. blue dream exceeded my expectations and iâ€™m always disappointed when i canâ€™t find it at my local dispensary.

Drunksherlock,I'm blue da ba dee da ba daa,5,blue-dream
mysticgirl5,"'I got a peaceful, easy feeling...' is the best way I can describe this strain. I've had it before, in vape, and back then I wasn't sure what the big deal was. It was just ok for me; strong enough to help me sleep but nothing particularly great. But then my dispensary had it in flower on their $2 menu and I thought 'what the hell, let's re-test the hype' and damn, this stuff is great. I think I got a more indica dominant hybrid because I am so freaking mellow right now and sativas do tend to make me anxious/paranoid. This stuff is so nice though. I feel very relaxed and calm, warm and toasty, snuggly and affectionate but content to clean our bedroom while my husband sleeps. It can definitely be a daytime strain and a really nice, soothing high at that while you get some work done. Housework at least; I don't think I'd do great at critical thinking right now but fuck it; I'm blissed out and I don't care. Definitely try this. If you tried it before and it sucked, try it again. It was most definitely worth the second chance.",5,blue-dream
Bad1N420,"It's a good hybrid, but being a mainly Indica smoker I have to say that it's Sativa Haze parental genes overpower the Indica in my opinion and yrs of experience with more than one place. To each their own, but always look into those parental strains for better understanding of your hybrids. Kind of like a book or math equation ...the parental genes make the end source. I always give The Sacred Herb a 5â˜† none the less!",4,blue-dream
reneefasano,This stuff makes me play coolmathgames.com.,5,blue-dream
AaronZ23,"Nice creative, deep thinking, high concentration, alert feeling.  Makes me sleepy but not too sleepy.  No issues falling asleep or staying awake.  There are perhaps more relaxing, less hyper-active and paranoid feeling strains than this one, but Blue Dream is nice for what I mentioned in the beginning of my review.",5,blue-dream
Cd305507,"Tasted bad, made me feel sick and dizzy",1,blue-dream
M.Derange,"This has been my go-to strain for over a year now. It's a great daytime strain. It eases my migraines and relaxes me without making me feel heavy, sleepy, or &quot;weighed-down&quot;. It's a very refreshing feeling, actually helps me to focus on tasks better.",5,blue-dream
Ajacob24,"This is an all time personal favorite. I tried this strain about 6 years ago. Itâ€™s a definite go to when you are needing a daytime smoke. Letâ€™s me be high but still have a clear head to get work done...Or if I wanted to just chill plays some video games, watch a movie, itâ€™s a perfect strain for that too. ",5,blue-dream

123Buddy,"Tried this for the first time today. Took two small hits from my vape and waited for about 20 minutes. Just when I thought I hadn't vaped enough, it kicked in.   The high is very relaxing but you still get a good head buzz as well. Great for just chilling on the couch or you can also be productive on it if you want.   Took almost all my pain away once it kicked in. Very happy with Blue Dream!",5,blue-dream

inflames.bm,What happened to my other review ,4,blue-dream
sywi,"Am I the only MJ user on the planet who doesn't adore Blue Dream? Must be my brain/body chemistry. I've tried it several times now, and it makes me feel anxious because I feel hazy and unmotivated but not profoundly relaxed on it. I HAVE had success mixing it with purer sativas to take the edge off, and I have some around just for that. But it obviously does more for a lot of folks, as it's consistently been &quot;the favorite strain in X&quot; while I've been paying attention.",3,blue-dream
billzipz,"This stuff is fantastic! Great strain, also has the nicest smell, I find it sort of fruity and sour kind of smell. Every time I open the jar of this stuff I stick my nose right in. Very mellow and good feeling, itâ€™ll put you in a good mood I promise ",5,blue-dream
Travim,"I absolutely love this strain, it's perfect for edibles",5,blue-dream
MYHIPPY7,"If you have OCD, this stain is not for you. It is an in the head strain for sure, locks you in the couch and traps you in your head!   Every time I try this strain I get more anxious and paranoid than I have with any other strain.   Could see itâ€™s use, just not for me",1,blue-dream
MobiusHedgehog,"An amazing pick-me-up strain that produces great euphoric effects along with blissful taste and aroma! The main benefits from Blue Dream that I've noticed is how productive, happy and cheerful that I am throughout the day and night.",5,blue-dream
patriciavaacama,This is something else  ...no I literally just said that I'm fly high on this bud rn. nice and fluffy buds that smell fruity. taste is just a bit pungent but goes down smooth. exhale is blueberry muffins. high is like you are I'm a dream but it's real life ( no wonder it's called blue dream) you feel great for a hour or two and then you feel motivated and relaxed. me and a few of my buddies smoked smoked some last night. my neck pain went away like it was never there. I could laugh but still be I. control. felt great after. and is great for sex too;-) 10 out of 10  ,5,blue-dream

MDH420,"Unless what I got wasn't blue dream, this strain makes people that I've smoked it with extremely paranoid, on edge, and even angry at times. It's benefits aren't that great and don't outweigh its short comings. ",3,blue-dream
zestyalaister,"I'm a new smoker. Trying Blue Dream made me feel drunk and nauseous, so I highly recommend for new comers to only take 2 hits max, otherwise Blue Dream will fuck you up! ",2,blue-dream
socasurfer,"Consumption: Vaporizer (The mighty and volcano), flower  Effects: Mild, invigorating head high that leaves you very clear and sharp with a relaxing body high that puts you at ease.  Smell: mild earthy, pungent floral, not super strong smell, but nice smooth smoke.  Taste: Earthy and floral, similar to smell, not super strong taste but definitely a sweeter floral flavor.  Overall: Legendary sativa dominant hybrid that's great for daytime use when you need to be functional (be advised some strains like platinum or super have slightly different effects). I can use blue dream and function in a variety of situations from work to family functions. Not a super creative high for me but feel very task-oriented.",5,blue-dream

ToneClonez,"Not the biggest fan of the high... Smoked it numerous times in and out of Washington state. Must say itâ€™s satisfying but lacking heavily on the taste, over the top, to be quite honest. I will be honest if a bud tender goes to select Blue Dream and assures me this is â€œwhere itâ€™s atâ€ù, they obviously have no clue who I am as a customer, lacks the knowledge(itâ€™s usually on sale). I will be very honest though itâ€™s not the best quality, as a grower itâ€™s very responsive, easy to manage and most definitely a strain you want in your garden... as I have crossed numerous plants with the Blue dream simply because the yields are heavyweights! Purple Urkle and Platinum GirlScout Cookies was Gas! You can definitely notice the size of buds especially when using LEDs",3,blue-dream

I smoked this and went for a bike ride cuz why not, I was so messed up I'm pretty sure I crash at least 6 or 7 times. It put me in to such a deep high I literally only remembered smoking it then waking up at home in my chair watching family guy. I love this strain the most because it got me so high, and at time gave me energy but also made me relaxed and super happy. It didn't give me the munchies that much so that was good because my past with afgan kush and sumer lemon haze have left me with eating at least 10 pounds of food. This put me in the head space of nothing mattered and that it was just me left on this earth. When I was watching family guy everything was distorted which I loved. Over all I would say this my favorite weed.",5,blue-dream
webpup,"Very happy feeling, my creativity is up, my anxiety is down   I love the taste and smell of blue dream    I got the one from aurora and I have to say that although I went through some negative issues with the OCS.ca website Iâ€™m very happy with this product   I feel very motivated on this strain, itâ€™s incredible!   Definitely recommend!!",4,blue-dream
DrPerkele,"We tried a ton of strains in May 2019 while visiting Canada and Blue Dream was by far the best of them all. My dad, who hasn't smoked much since his youth, was knocked flat by it, and my partner and I had the best time, feeling so good and happy and goofy and fun. Highly recommended! ",5,blue-dream

subsdad,Really good.,3,blue-dream
Codyloc915,This strain is great for lazy-motivated stoners. It helps a bit with pain but it is more of one to keep your mind off all your problems.  1-2 hits in the morning can kick start your day to be a good one and at the end of the day smoke about 1/4-1/2 gram (depending on mood) to erase your stress from the day and get ready for bed. ,5,blue-dream
LouLou918,This is my overall favorite!  The best for pain and maintaining a normal life without feeling completely stoned.  It's a great medicinal strain.  I love how much my creativity increases!  Thank you Nirvana.,5,blue-dream

SpanishGuitarist,"I relate to this strain as a medical strain that uplifts facing woes in life, relaxes muscles, and is a strain that does not alter normal interaction with the outside world. I tried it several times for allergies and related headaches, and it is a miracle for that.  Blueberry/Haze Genetics:  The Blueberry/Haze mix sounds like a mix of polar opposites. The Blueberry is from  DJ Short,  bread exotic strains that integrated Indica varieties with the international set of Sativa strains that were intense.   Haze can make some feel racy, unfocused and anxious. Or for some, an out-of-body experience.   With Blue Dream the unwanted side effects of either strain disappear and create a kind and gentle strain that I feel is more for medical purposes than recreational. It is not the most exciting strain.  Yet popular demand proves me wrong. In California Blue Dream disappears of the shelf, and is preferred by many for social settings. I put Blue Dream in a unique category as Blueberry Muffin, also from the same Indica roots, as sophisticated cannabis that is healing without being too &quot;Stoney&quot; too function as a normal human being.",4,blue-dream
Haillucifer,Awesome great high,5,blue-dream
jdsappraiser,"I use this strain medicinally throughout the day. The 1:1 ratio is superb for mental focus without that speedy sativa feeling. So far, I do more work, stay more task-oriented and have better follow-through with my work. Also, the first week I was feeling this strain out, I got super creative and built a bookshelf.

owen_oliver,"This is my go-to strain for relaxing, writing, and sleeping.

bluedreamblazer,"The most godlike strain of marijuana ever created. The small amount of indica in this strain is just for the delicious fruity blueberry smell. The high comes from the haze since blue dream is predominantly a sativa dominant hybrid. Sometimes, you will notice some growers will make a more indica heavy strain. Good blue dream is extremely frosty, good smelling, with a moderate lasting high. It is a very upbeat drug and will wake you up but it can also make you tired and put you to sleep.

Heshianpriest,"A pretty good go to. As the description states this strain is generally a sativa dominant but can sometimes lean towards the indica side (though not often).  This strain is sort of like an umbrella â€œchronicâ€ù strain as they called them 15-20 years ago. Generally widely available across the west, itâ€™s pretty common and cheap. Quality is always guaranteed. Color and scent of blueberry is almost always apparent (the indica leaning BD tends to smell more like diesel in my experience).   If you want value for your buck, this strain is great! Many a time have I gotten discounts on ounces of blue dream. Personally, this has more recreational uses than medical as the strain can have the aforementioned variations. That being said, if you consistently smoke this strain it can get old pretty quick so some variety is recommended.",4,blue-dream
Vester2018,"WOW! Sativa head high is very high, and the Indica relaxed on couch (no couch lock) is definitely there, just enjoying this Amazing Hybrid and listening to meditation music, and on my iPad enjoying what is left of this beautiful warm afternoon.

I got this from Circle of Hope in the valley, they have a Tuesday and Sunday deal on flower at this shop. I bought an eighth of this flower for $22 something before tax. It is from Old Pal Classic &quot;Shareable&quot; Flower.  Very good flower for this price!!!   I have vaped the flower and smoked the flower.",5,blue-dream

edoras,"I was given a few seeds of this strain from a friend, in the Humboldt seeds wooden box. I sprouted 1, and grew it in organic soil that I amended. the plant vegged for month and half, I placed it in flower when the plant was around 4 ft tall, which was a huge mistake, this plant really stretches in flower. limiting veg time is a must, the buds on the Pheno I had were very light and fluffy, with a heavy spicy berry aroma. i flowered for 9 weeks, but should have gone 10 at least, ending up with 5 OZs of bud from a 600 watt HPS. the high is motivating with a relaxing finish and is used to treat my wife's depression, it is in NO WAY, over powering or overly potent which makes treating a mental illness better. this is a great strain for Depression, bi polar, anxiety.",5,blue-dream

Has a sweet, enjoyable flavor &amp; the smell is very welcoming. It's a mellow mix of Indica &amp; Sativa. A neutral hybrid. Level playing-field.",5,blue-dream
1012crew,"Purchased at the SQDC in Quebec. Blue Dream by Aurora. 19% THC. When I bought it i thought it would be too strong for me as I am sensitive to THC. I loaded my Utilian with 0.15g of Blue dream and man..it was great. Felt a mild head high that came in almost immediatly. Felt calm and happy, slightly uplifted but not energetic like a pure sativa does to me. Then after about 30 minutes I felt even more relaxed throughout my body and the head high diminished a little. After about 2 hours I started getting sleepy so I just drifted off and had some of the nicest sleep i had in my life. Closed my eyes and opened them 2 minutes before the alarm clock.",5,blue-dream

chaaanny,"This is hands down my favorite strain. Extremely clear-headed with a lasting euphoria, and eliminates my anxiety/depression completely. It also gives me a noticeable boost in creativity.  But probably my favorite part of BD is that I can â€œturn it (the high) on or offâ€ù as needed, making it perfect for times when I need to be more discreet. And at least for me, I donâ€™t get dry eyes/mouth, dizzy, or the munchies (those snacks add up!). So basically no negative side effects for me.  Canâ€™t go wrong in any form-flower, concentrates, etc. ",5,blue-dream

Pete11385,"Blue Dream is nice when you want that combination of Relaxation and Euphoria leaning more to the Sativa side. Great after work smoke when you come home, put on a pot of tea and stoke the cat.  Makes you want to listen to music, read and watch tv and all the same time. Great strain for multitasking.  Does not make you want to go out however and do stuff like the pure Sativas do but rather makes you want to do things indoors, anything from cleaning the kitchen to watching and movie. Gives you the munchies to boot.  Has a slight sexual stimulation about it and puts you somewhat in the mood.  Makes you more jovial and able to I socialize if you do decide to break out of the house.  Finally, when itâ€™s all done and it lasts a good while it eases you gently off to sleep like a fluttering cascade of Midsummer Nights Dream Shakespearean Fairies where you dream of Middle Earth and having tea with Bilbo.

wh67,"After researching and reading reviews, me and my girlfriend were very excited to experience Blue Dream's creative properties and get high as hell. It did not disappoint.  The buds were moist, covered in crystals, and smelt absolutely stunning. We decided to roll &quot;too much&quot; in our scooby doob in order to get a full feel of the strain.  We're not claiming to be marijuana connoisseurs but it definitely left us with a sweet taste in our soon to be dry mouths.  I personally get a tight feeling in my chest when I smoke, and it would be fair to say that the Blue Dream definitely exacerbated it. My girlfriend also mentioned her heart racing and feeling a bit paranoid, but DO NOT let this put you off.  Five minutes after finishing the zoot, its effects began to wash over us rather like a rising tide. Our legs tingled and I felt like my brain was getting a massage. We were compelled to do something, anything, productive. We cleaned, we tidied, we baked and it felt like we were just getting started. We sat in front of the television, and this is where our journey began.  The soothing voice of David Attenborough ushered us into Madagascar. We were instantly captivated, transported from a small bedroom in the North to a jungle off the east coast of Africa in a matter of seconds. HS2 can suck it. My jaw literally dropped at the sight of minute lizards, baby monkeys and lemurs. We thought of nature in a completely different way.  The 'come-down' was soft and we chatted for the rest of the evening. We were high for over three hours and didn't feel sober by bed-time about six hours after sparking the Jumbo Dumbo. Long-lasting effects are a must for me, and this didn't just tick the box, it WAS the box.  + Great daytime weed + Sociable + Productive + No couchlock = Keeps you awake - Racing heart - Slightly paranoid   Two words: Instant classic",4,blue-dream
woamotive,"I absolutely love this strain. When I pick this up, it is beautiful, wonderfully cultivated, grower takes great pride. Immediately, upon first toke - hits your head, your temples, a bit of tingling that spreads throughout your body. It's at this point when stress leaves the body and you can feel 'at peace' and reflect. Or, I can sometimes feel as though my focus is 'super sharp' and go about nearly any task - procrastination dissipates.    This also could work nicely for mild to moderate pain relief. I'd note that, due to its potency  - it is not for someone who doesn't smoke often, or doesn't smoke high level strains, or have pain issues = anxiety/paranoia DOES occur at times.",4,blue-dream

My body was completely relaxed. My anxiety melted away. Most important though, was my permanent smile as soon as this kicked in. Everything was more interesting, and funny.

infinitefire,"A glass of red wine at the end of the day is just not gonna cut it anymore. Only Blue Dream can truly tale the edge off. Finally,â€™a strain I genuinely feel better with! I have MS, so I suffer from Chronic Fatigue, cognition and visual impairment, anxiety and depression, so I hate strains that make me feel glued to the couch, anxious, paranoid, or dumb so Blue Dream is the strain for me. I do not get the munchies which is good. It also is very smooth and delicious so it doesnt exacerbate my asthma unlike some other atrains like AK-47 and Mauie Wowie. It doesnt give me bounds of energy, but it keeps me awake enough to enjoy wjatever Im doing, and supports me from falling into the black abyss of fatigue attack. A gentle euphoria but I still have all my wits about me. Whatever Im doing, Im still in complete control, without the worrying. This is like a massage for my soul. It smoothes out the kinks in my psyche and melts away the stress. Also, this strain seems to have long-term benefits. Ever since Ive been smoking this more frequently, my creativity has been amplified, even on days I havent smoked, which is wonderful. Being calmer allows me the patience and trust in myself to create new ideas. I can â€œseeâ€ù revolutionary concepts I couldnt quite tap into before. I can access my inner genius with greater ease and confidence. Thank you Blue Dream! ",5,blue-dream

Took less than 3 minutes to start to feel it once vaporized, and the high keeps you just far enough so you can have a great experience, but not far enough to make you a Slug.  Anyway.

I was hoping it could be a go to strain for working during the day, while being medicated.  Blue Dream does give me energy but also puts me on edge and ready for a fight.  It helps with my pain, a little, but overall itâ€™s not pleasant.  I definitely canâ€™t be around people while Iâ€™m on it.  I loaded a concentrate oil syringe into a vape cart. The flavor is what I would imagine taking super glue and covering a chicken breast with it might taste like.",2,blue-dream
EmVibe,I love the flower itâ€™s self but lately Iâ€™ve been grabbing the pens as a better grab-n-go method. The carriage I got of course is one of my classic faves. Blue dream doesnâ€™t make me feel lazy or groggy which I like because Iâ€™m usually working during the day and needing at least a good pull or two of my oil pen to get me through the day. definitely a great strain when working out too. Keeps me focused or when Iâ€™m home I get really focused into the movie. Love love love wth is strain definitely recommend the oil pens if you donâ€™t feel like inhaling actual smoke. Oil definitely hits you faster too. ,5,blue-dream
mm92599,"I, unfortunately had a terrible experience with this strain.  I was given a free pre-rolled gram at the dispensary and since I had never tried Blue Dream before, I only took about 4 hits (used up approx. 1/3 of the joint).  About 5 minutes after I took my last hit, I was out for the count.  Completely incapacitated and incoherent.  Extremely dizzy, nauseous and my head was spinning.  All I could do was lye on the ground and wait for it to end.  It took more than 24 hours before I finally started to feel somewhat normal.  It was almost like I immediately felt hung over and the hangover lasted forever.  I realize that 99.9% of those who use this strain will not have had the same type of experience, but Iâ€™m only sharing my personal experience with this strain and for me it was absolutely terrible.",1,blue-dream

It leaves an awesome after taste having you crave for seconds_Ÿ˜„ along with the energy it has provided me with a good 3-4 hours of pain relief. I suffer from chronic lower back and leg pain and with this I feel so much better. I works nights so this has also help with staying awake when I need to.

sadiebooger,"If you look very closely at the pics of the buds, you should notice some really nice veins and some cool veins on buds in the middle of the bud, which is where the leaf is going to be in the future. I've used this strain before, and I've had success with other strains like bbq weed, and I will say that bud strains like bbq or pbq are good for getting a high for a few weeks. Then your going to burn your buds out, but once you are ready, and your not smoking much again in a few days, then you can smoke some marijuana. I really enjoy smoking hash like this, because it has almost zero psychoactivity, and very fast reaction times (if there is any) after smoking it. I'll post some pics of my first session of smoked with this as well. If you decide to try this in your garden, it can definitely be used to treat any of your herb problems, even weed allergies. Also, this is not a full recipe, just a description of what to cook up. First, I'm going to make some fresh blueberry slushies.

boyndog,"In a lot of ways, Blue Dream epitomizes where cannabis is heading.  It's a crowd pleaser.  It works.  It's reliable.  The truth is, that makes Blue Dream a little 'boring'.  Staid almost (like anything cannabis can be 'staid').  It definitely isn't sexy.  If we were comparing it to red wine, we'd call it a 'quaffing wine'.  Great for a party, maybe not the top choice for a gourmet dinner.  But if you're having a burger instead of filet mignon?  Blue Dream is perfect. The euphoria comes on quickly.  It's not a Big Euphoria -- but a Distinct Euphoria.  It's great for working, doing errands, hanging out.  Life's equivalent of 'quaffing'.",4,blue-dream

FutchAndCalli,"Blue Dream is a decent strain to be sure. But itâ€™s only a solid B as a weed for sex. Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s strong ratings come from it being everywhere and the first quality strain many new users encounter. However, it suffers from the problem I find with many hybrids: they are good at everything, but great at nothing (other than being good). We generally shy away from hybrids like this, where people describe a range of experiences and a â€œchoose your own adventureâ€ù ability to steer it in a sativa or indica direction.  We much prefer strains with more distinct characteristics so we know what weâ€™re getting. That way we can choose a strain that fits the mood and time of day rather than trying to steer through the high and hoping it works out. However, if youâ€™re new to this and want a â€œjack of all tradesâ€ù strain, you can do a lot worse than Blue Dream. Itâ€™s just not for us unless the choices are seriously limited.   We are 50-somethings who vape and have sex pretty much daily. All our reviews focus on our experiences mixing cannabis and sex. We only rate after using an oz so the reviews give a well-rounded impression that captures a strainâ€™s potential, downsides, and typical effects.  ",4,blue-dream

kimdavis3,"This is one of my favorite strains!!!  I am a daily user and the effects for me are very strong and intense and, very enjoyable.  For me, mostly a head high.  It makes me talkative, happy, goofy and generally in good spirits.  I could still focus on tasks, as long as they weren't too complicated.  For me this is definitely a strain where you want to be in an unstructured or party environment.  I would suggest using this strain for pain relief as I think it is distracting and could take your mind off your pain.  I strongly encourage those who can handle the effects to use it for lack of appetite!!  I gain weight when using this strain for any period of a week or more, because I always get the munchies after using it.  Usually it takes two or three sessions, but after the effects are waning I become ravenous - especially for sugar and salt.  Definitely one of the better strains around in my opinion.",5,girl-scout-cookie

You don't want get loaded to write the next great American novel or shred powder up in Whistler or frag n00bs in Counter-Strike -- y'just wanna get high and groove to Pink Floyd. Well, Girl Scout Cookies knows all about your cravings for some melodious Prog Rock goodness. Have you ever heard about that thing where if you start Dark Side of the Moon at the same time as you take your first hit of GSC, you'll be high to the tits by the time Speak To Me ends and the buzz lasts about as long as The Wall? It's true! This weed loves Pink Floyd so much that it even makes the David Gilmour era stuff sound good. HAHAHAAH! Just kidding: you know as a Floyd fan that you stop listening at The Final Cut and pretend the rest of that shit never happened. Especially The Endless River -- I mean, what the fuck, Gilmour? I know Waters is a dick and everything, but as least the man can write some lyrics! Aaaaaanyway, when it comes time to put on your headphones, lean back in your chair, and become obscured by clouds, THIS is the dank-ass weed you want launching you into interstellar overdrive.",5,girl-scout-cookie
BenchAdventures,"This is what I've been smoking recently when I don't need to &quot;do&quot; anything. If you're like me, you'll want to make sure the floor is clear of tripping hazards, your laptop is away from your water, etc. Set out some snacks before you start smoking, and make sure you're in a safe environment. Hybrids generally put me in the couch more than Indica, but GSC makes fine motor skills especially hard. It's also especially dense, in my experience, which made eyeball-measuring my bowl difficult. The first time I smoked this I had a little too much. Stood up, got extremely dizzy (ears ringing, etc.), tried to put my bong back in a high cupboard, fainted, and ended up knocking over a box of crackers that my cat later peed on. It was a mess. (My bong was thankfully okay.) If you're like me, don't hesitate to pack a small bowl and go back for another one if needed.",5,girl-scout-cookie
UDtheAesir,"Great strain! True to Leafly's description, it WILL send your mind on a helluva journey! I've had this before a few times, but it seems like this time, it really shines! I strongly recommend smoking this out of a pipe or chillum. Anything with water in it like a bubbler or a bong just cuts down on its potency. Definitely use a small bowl pipe, you don't need alot of it if you're smoking by yourself.  It seems like it's similar to White Widow's effects, just more sharper and focused, and hits faster. You'll find yourself completely lost in your thoughts and still have enough functionality to get around in the house to do whatever you need to do before finally chilling and riding out the rest of the high. Like White Widow, its a great meditative strain, super-functional on the mental scale. It's like the strain has a very helpful mind of its own, guiding you closer to solutions of your own issues, kind of like what a Boy Scout or a Girl Scout would do with other people, always lending a helping hand. Learned a great deal as this somehow switched my mind around to the point it's like an ongoing Jeopardy! thing going on.  All in all, GREAT time with this strain! I should definitely look into growing some of my own! Watch out for the munchies, though. If you've had alot to eat beforehand, then you should be okay.  Smoke happy, friends!",5,girl-scout-cookie
i_miss_u_cupcake,"This is a treat I rarely get to experience. Upon opening the package, an all-encompassing aroma washes over me, putting a grin immediately on my face. And it is so beautiful. Whoever made this needs medals. Lots of f*****g medals. After the first taste, happiness rushes in. So tasty. I can't believe what I am experiencing. It feels like I'm becoming a child again. A very focused child. Focused on eating that is! And now I have consumed too much and need to lie down. But seriously, next time someone comes to your door and asks if you want cookies. You say YES! Nothing like some Girl Scout Cookies. Samoas are my favorite. ...  EDIT: Ohh.. the weed. Yea, that was good, too. For a full review, read this review again.",4,girl-scout-cookie

I've tried so many strains trying to find a feeling of happiness and this is it. This is heaven. This is life. I just feel so much love for the world. My entire body vibrates.

Perfect for daytime use. No couch lock. I can still function and carry on conversations without tripp'n. Makes me feel like I did when I first started smoking back in the day. Not a care in the world and a permagrin on my face. Also, amazing with Led Zeppelin and The Beatles.",5,girl-scout-cookie
kushys1,"I can't say enough about this strain. I have panic attacks and severe back pain. I was taking all kinds of pills, then decided to try marijuana. Girl Scout Cookies was the first strain I tried. I was suffering from a very painful sciatica pain, took a puff and within seconds, I felt no pain at all. I was amazed that something could have such a quick effect. This strain is part of the reason, marijuana is legal medically. This strain is truly proof, it's not just sleepy old pot anymore. It will cure what several pills can barely do, in a fraction of the time. Hands down the best strain for pain ever!",5,girl-scout-cookie
MurfDog19,"I finally got my hands on the legendary Cookies, and I was not dissapointed. The smell and taste are very unique, unlike any strain I've tried. Many describe the smell as fresh baked cookies, though I'd describe it more as the aftermath of cookie baking. The high is very, very nice. Anxiety, stress and pain disappear almost instantly. The head high is quite focused. The perfect high. I typically disregard trends, as they never live up to the reputation. GSC certainly lives up to its reputation. Highly recommended!",5,girl-scout-cookie

RainDropDropTopImAidanGerberAndThisIsMyDankPot,"100% my current favourite strain. GSC is a very uplifting and almost surreal high. It made me very relaxed while also letting my thoughts flow. It kept me very happy  and smiling throughout the entire high. Only downside I can find for GSC would be the dry mouth throughout most of the high (which is not uncommon). Although you get the dry mouth, if you've got access to something to drink then you'll be perfectly fine. If you're ever looking for a happy, uplifting, and euphoric high, I would 10/10 recommend trying this strain if the opportunity ever arises.",5,girl-scout-cookie

The Gsc hit me quickly after my first hits off a hot-water bong with an inline stem precooler. The effects were fully realized after about 10 minutes, and included the mild body tingling noted by some previous reviewers, v good pain relief, reduction in nausea with increase in appetite, and an overall sense of engaged well-being. Great head high, reminiscent of that great sensi Thai stick from the 70s (ReAlLy dating myself here!). Great, sensual body stone as well; walking &amp; puttering far less painful.

This strain really distracts you from all the other things which are going on around you and makes you focus on one thing at a time.

MZ_PHD_in_420,"I have 40+ years experience growing and using cannabis, a masters degree in agri/horticulture from MSU. This review is more of a warning and a review than most of my other reviews. The review is of the actual flower which I have never produced myself but am pretty sure I have sampled the real deal. I agree with every positive review, if you indeed get the real deal but my warning is that with the exception of the flower itself and obtaining it from a reliable source, any clones or seeds that are said to be GSC are highly unlikely to be. I have seen and know of many people that paid for supposed GSC clones and seeds and none of them were GSC and actually none of them were of any quality at all, so there are a lot of people selling items claiming to be GSC when they are actually total junk. Unlike other people trying to copy the strain and producing a great strain that may not be the same but good in its own right, it seems most of the people claiming to have this strain are completely lying and selling complete junk. Now obviously this isn't the case all the time, but from what I have seen, it is the most counterfeited strain I have witnessed, so please be aware of this if you are trying to obtain clones or seeds. I would only get them from a place that has both a sample of the flower AND whatever else they are offering so you can at least see what you should expect. This is the reason I would love to have but have no experience growing, because even though I have a lot of reliable connections for many strains, this is one I have not been able to trust the source enough to commit to growing it. That doesn't mean you don't, I'm just warning people to be careful.",3,girl-scout-cookie

The taste was Minty, Piney and Earthy.  I was almost tempted to describe this high that as creeping up on ya... but then I realized I was about 50 yards into my walk to the taco shop, which is about a mile away from where I live.  No my Cannabis Smokers this weed does not creep.  Comes on strong and stays strong in the best ways possible.  No racey heart, just great THC Psychedelics  and Happiness.  The effects pleasantly and slowly fade over the course of 3 hours.  This Extremely popular strain speaks to the &quot;Mind&quot; and says &quot;Let's Party !&quot;",5,girl-scout-cookie
EddyHaze,"Ok, here's where i stand with GSC. it's a very nice high when you smoke. It has very sweet and earthy undertones. It has a tendancy to creep up on you, and before you know it, you're on a trip. I didn't feel any paranoia. Except for the usual &quot;can anyone tell I'm high?&quot; but i do feel slightly dizzy when i mellow out. If you're prone to getting dizzy when you smoke i would recommend a small dose of GSC. However it does also give you a mean cotton mouth. Still a very powerful strain for beginners. And an enjoyable one for veteran tokers. 4.5 stars imo",4,girl-scout-cookie
micantewaste54,"I like GSC. It helps the fibromyalgia pain as well as the anxiety caused by both PTSD and Bi-polar disorder. I am praying that PTSD will be given as a legitimate reason to use medical marijuana. My PTSD is a result of sexual abuse/rapes. I began smoking pot as a teenager not really knowing at the time I was &quot;self medicating.&quot; I began suffering flashbacks when I was 28 and the trigger was my son turn 5, the age that I was molested the first time. As I progressed into my 30s the flashbacks started and were horrible. Marijuana helped me deal with what was happening along with counseling. I stopped using pot when I was in 1999 but continued using prescription psychiatric meds to deal with my symptoms as well as pain meds, muscle relaxers, etc. Last year I went back to marijuana and when I was able to financially I got my medical marijuana card and as a result have gotten off three psychiatric meds. I still take two. Pills have caused me to have liver issues, weight gain, and other problems. I am grateful that Arizona voters saw the need for medical marijuana and voted to pass the use into law. I guess I got off the subject a bit.

215CutReviews629,"  In the mid-16th century, when the tulip was first introduced there, Western Europe fell in love with the new flower.  The Dutch simply couldnâ€™t get enough of the late blooming Tulip, contract prices on bulbs soared to ten times the average annual income of a skilled craftsman - for a single bulb!  What goes up, must come down, and prices quickly collapsed, resulting in what many economists say is the first economic bubble.         Girl Scout Cookies, allegedly a three-way cross of OG Kush, Durban Poison, and Cherry Kush (one stage of the cross being an accidental pollination from a hermaphroditic flower), was available to a few limited people who knew somebody in the Bay Area.  When it first found its way to the Harborside clone counter, it was available for $50, or some such nonsense.  It could be had a few weeks earlier on Craigslist for $500.  Of course, counterfeits abounded, both at Harborside, and on Craigslist.  Iâ€™m sure many unfortunate investors watched as their $500 cuts grew slowly (and it is a slow-growing cut) toward motherhood as prices tumbled, or cloned out their exclusive cookie cut just in time to find out it was actually sour diesel.        I got mine when Dark Heart's cuts of it fell to under $20. That was a little over a year ago.  Now, cookie cuts seem to cost the same as everything else does.       This is an indeterminate cut, that starts a little slow, but stretches late into flower, forming solid branches, studded at intervals with dense, trichome covered buds.  The leaves accumulate chlorophyll, growing deep green in the late weeks of flower, breaking to a rich purple with cooler conditions and a proper flush.        Although the buds are dense, and of an easy and uniform quality, the yield is lower, due to greater spacing of individual internodes, and a lesser tendency to grow out its secondary branches.  It does train well, but because of late stretch, will often grow in a taller, sparse patch, when compared to most other strains.  This plant burns relatively easily, as it tends to concentrate nutrients in its fan leaves.  This means that it requires both a longer flush, and a gentle hand with the bloom fertilizers.        This plant, true to its origins, has shown a tendency to create the occasional staminate (male) flower, without much rhyme or reason as to its cause.  These tend to form lower on the plant, in the first few weeks of flower, directly next to the stamen at the base of an internode on a main stem.  They are not a cause for alarm, and will rarely pollinate neighboring plants, but they do occasionally pollinate the stamen theyâ€™re attached to.  In this case, the stamen attached to the stem will begin to swell.  The seeds formed will be a feminized self copy of the original plant, no more or less likely to hermie than its mother. My current cutting of cookies is actually a grown out seed from a flowered plant.  I have found these seeds a few times.       This plant produces almost completely dense buds when grown with a reasonable canopy depth.  Waiting until the second or third week of flower to trim undergrowth will help somewhat with density, while avoiding stretch. I find that this cut takes 9-10 weeks to finish.      The cured buds have aromas of menthol, lemon grass, dankness, and a hint of curacao.  Early in the cure, menthol predominates, fading while the dankness increases as the cure progresses.  The final effect after a few months is a minty sour diesel with extra dankness.  The overall intensity of this cut is impressive, in terms of aroma, density, and potency.      Any cut with such intense popularity will attract its detractors, and Cookies is no exception.  This cut has several downsides: low yield, difficult stretch, a tendency to burn and a long flush time.  The first batch of Cookies crosses and variants (Iâ€™ve even got a Blue Cheese x Cookies cut I worked up that shows promise) are just starting to arrive at the clone counters, and eventually weâ€™re likely to see a cross that retains the good while losing all the bad.  But for now, if you want a jar full of Cookies, youâ€™ll have to make do.  ",4,girl-scout-cookie

Relaxed, happy, no anxiety, light munchies. Heres the unique thing we found about it: we could sort of pause our high and have a serious discussion, then return to being high. Sound weird? I dont know how else to explain it. Sort of like a buzz toggle we could turn on and off. In other words, we were stoned, but we could still think very lucidly and have a totally normal conversation, or a goofy one . That's the best I can explain it. Long story short : this is a great strain. Love it. But skip it if you want to get deep because it's not a cerebral, introspective, dramatic high. It's very chill.

Also excellent for increasing libido and general sensuality.  Beautiful, sweet scent (almost like cotton candy at the first clean smoke) and great vibrant green color.",4,girl-scout-cookie

beatles419,"A top 10 favorite strain of mine.  The durban poison and cherry pie makes for an unforgettable sativa dominant experience.  It's the trippiest shit ive had. Time slows way down and I'm either deep in though kr laughing uncontrollably while my mind races, much like a good trip.  The taste is a little like purple bisquick.  A strain thats a must havd from time to time. The purp in the genetics keeps the durban poison from causing any anxiety.",5,girl-scout-cookie

fhs123,"Girl Scout Cookies~F1 Durban x OG kush although alot of clubs add cherry kush which is fine but not the original GSC strain created in San Francisco.  Adding the cherry kush gives you a whole different high, so i stick to the original formula F1 Durban x OG Kush.  Well where do i start, nugs were like dense rocks covered in crystals with long curly yellow hairs sprouting out of it..making the nug look golden.  Took a hit in my pipe tasted like dessert on the exhale, your in for a treat.  Took 2 good hits to start feeling this medication.  The buzz was super long and ends with the munchies seriously.  Overall the high is euphoric and happy good daytime use, not for beginners. rate 10 out of 10",5,girl-scout-cookie
chrisjchurch,"I am new to medical marijuana, there are many others here with more sage opinions.  But as a newbie, my psychiatrist recommended I start with 9 Pound Hammer for my PTSD anxiety before bed.  The budtender suggested an alternative, Girl Scout Cookies, and I have been very happy with it!  GSC get me high, but more importantly effectively treats my nighttime anxiety and vivid dreams/flashbacks.  I am very glad that Trulieve is as good a teacher as they are, and that I started with this strain.  Enjoy!",5,girl-scout-cookie

Overall very impressive, I'm naturally anxious but this strain didn't induce those feelings. Just happy and high!",4,girl-scout-cookie
TimeTraveller,"Much like Blue Dream, GSC is a popular, versatile strain, great in small doses for a buzzy green day or in slightly larger doses for a deeply relaxing yet stimulating evening. Sometimes, this strain can be a bit too psychoactive for me, given the strength of its Durban Poison parent. Unless you purchase a sun-grown variety, GSC strains can be generally high on the THC potency scale. So yes, for more controlled hydroponic variants, a little goes a long way. Baking, however, is the best use of this strain - by far! They don't call it &quot;Girl Scout Cookies&quot; for nothing; grind it, weigh it, and mix it into your brownie mix or cookie dough batter. The flavor blends particularly well with rich, dense baked goods, lending them a very mild and unassuming hint of cannabis without overpowering the edible's natural flavor. What's more, if consumed in edible form, digestion takes the potentially-strong Sativa edge off, turning your baked goods into wonderful after-dinner desserts.",4,girl-scout-cookie
hotrod1228,"This is the 4th time that I've had Girl Scout cookies and everytime I fall in love all over again I've been stuck is with some midshelf nugs for the last week or two , and thank the Lord I got a delivery of rock OG and Girl Scout cookies.

In less than 5 minutes I couldn't hear right there was massive pressure at the back of my eyes and euphoria slowly creep through my body hallelujah girl scout cookies",5,girl-scout-cookie
AvaMN,"GSC is one of my favorites. Great body high and great for those struggling with insomnia. It's uplifting and euphoric but will simultaneously put you right to bed if that's what you're using it for. If not, you can still be social without getting too groggy. ",5,girl-scout-cookie
TribbleCon32,"Holy shit, this stuff is the real deal.  I struggle with depression and anxiety and typically try to stay away from sativas and unresearched hybrids, but after a recommendation, I tried GSC.  Well it works like a fucking charm. I felt amazing, happy, confident, and excited for the first time in a while. Of course I only vape this at night, but for me it's a very functional high, but also very relaxing.",5,girl-scout-cookie
ynotwbc,"For me, this is how weed should be. This strain is a gift. Iâ€™ve had three near exact and perfect batches from the same grower. Green and purple buds which are always small, soft and dense little nugs just sand blasted with silver dust.   Zero paranoia and just a calm happy high. So happy. It can be social and itâ€™s great when your alone too. Itâ€™s an Indica dominant hybrid effect for me. Comes on really heady and strong at first then mellows out. Expect to be high for 2-3 hrs.   Time just passes blissfully by. Beautiful beautiful stain. Great for deep sleep and appetite. ",5,girl-scout-cookie
VapeQueen710,"Method: Heavy Hitters Vape Cartridge.  Aroma: Sweet and doughy. 1/1 Star.  Taste: Oh, honey no. I know this is particular to the cartridge but man it was like spritzing perfume into your mouth, including the coughing and gagging fit that followed. My eyes were watering. However, I believe this to be just a bad representation of the strain. 1/2 Stars.  Feel: Stoned to the bone. Do not mess with Heavy Hitters. Here's what I wrote after two hits: &quot;I'm effing faded holy sh*t. Upper body heavy. Dizzy. Feeling waves through body. I need to lie down.&quot; And then I woke up several hours later. It was overwhelming and did not mesh well with my depression and anxiety. Not for me but I know some seek such strong experiences. 1/2 Stars.  Ranking: I wanted to love it so badly as this strain parents several of my favorites and is so beloved, I even bought a 1g cartridge instead of the 0.5g. Alas, disappointment and the first experience of a cannabis &quot;hangover.&quot; I like hybrids that make me giggle and laugh, this one just punches me in the face with every hit. I haven't felt this way since Blue Dream. Don't worry, I'll find it in flower form and try it and rank it again. Happy Holidays and New Year!  Total: 3/5 Stars.",3,girl-scout-cookie
ORGANIC_AL,"I grow this every year and I love it! I like that when it flowers the smell isnâ€™t overwhelming. I also can plant in July and easily get 1lb per plant.

CyclingAroundU,"Iâ€™ve been using GSC exclusively for the past two weeks to allow for this review. I really like GSC, The main trait that seems to be consistent is; very little Anxiety. Very little. Most strains with a double digit THC can make me nervous. GSC was more of a closed eyed stoned persona. No chance of walking around in public even with shades. No chance. GSC gets you there in a big way. Buy it when itâ€™s available in your dispensary.",5,girl-scout-cookie
Miamore,"Definitely a preferred choice! Smells amazing!! I puff on GSC to both relax after work or to get things done around the house. I've also gotten a boost of creativity (I do lots of arts and crafts).

StonedMoonPie,"This strain is one of a kind! I suffer from a back problem that causes me daily pain in my hips/feet/back but this strain melts the pain away and I forget I was even in pain! I find it's more of a head and body high that is good to relax with a good movie marathon! Overall it has a earthy, minty sent and taste that burns smooth and leaves you floating on a cloud!   Its also one of the first strain that we decided to grow at home since legalization, definitely the first strain we bought seeds for, and so far it's the best of the plants with a crazy number of buds growing all over!

Nice flowery pine notes, paired with an almost earthy baked good taste itâ€™s delicious to say the least. The effects come on fast and strong too with almost overwhelming but extremely pleasant head high before sending you coasting through the day! Creative, uplifting and giggly head high combined with top notch relaxation make this strain a powerhouse.

So I would recommend this to folks like me that do suffer stress and depression , best money I've ever spent so don't be scared just because its strong . I'll give 5 out of 5",5,girl-scout-cookie

PineappleScott,"GSC ... ( the artist formerly known as girl scout cookie )   I have been waiting a looooong time to try this one. Tonight was the night.   This strain's reputation speaks for itself. You've heard of it. Who hasn't ? It's one of today's most iconic strains. It seems like everything has some sort of &quot;cookies&quot; in it ? If they mix it in with that many strains it must be awesome right ?!   Well sort of ....   This pot smelled like pot. With a name like &quot;cookies&quot; I expected something a little more subtle.  I thought &quot; ok ... yup , that's pot &quot; . Lets move along.   I loaded up a bowl of the greenish purple ( almost black ) flower and lit up. The cannabis burned rather quickly and hot. The throat hit took a second and burned pretty bad. It was one of the more harsh smokes i've had in awhile.   The flavor was not sweet at all ... it was very &quot;chemically&quot; almost like you were smoking pine sol. &quot;Candyland&quot; tasted alot similar if you're familiar with that. &quot; It must be some irony here &quot; I thought to myself as I pondered on the weeds namesake. There is nothing sweet or &quot;Cookie-ie&quot; about this stuff. It smells and tastes like shit as well as hitting your throat like an afterburner to a SR-71 blackbird! Not what I was expecting at all.   Then the ol GSC kicked in ... It came rather quickly and hit hard. Like a freight train actually and I had a really hard time remembering things. Everything had a green color sort of kaleidoscope thing going on. Very Very psychedelic. When you look at a tye dye shirt ? That is how you are going to feel. All over the place in an abyss of color. Stunning visual effects. This stuff kicked my ass. Very Very Strong. Do not take around kids or in a situation where you might be needed to drive or anything. You wouldnt (should'nt).   My mind felt very quiet. Alot of pot makes me feel like i'm in this wind tunnel. GSC made me feel like I was the only human in space , and everything was quiet. Dead quiet.   For someone with a really deep depression or in need of a wild pain relief or anxiety bomb. This would probably do something for you. I know we've all had those times where we just want to hit the ejection button. This will hit that button for you. You will eject into the vastness and silence of space. And for better or for worse you'll have whatever thoughts you take in there with you, and nothing else.   This is really going to smack the hell out of you psychologically.    So I would say this is more of a &quot;hail mary&quot; medicinally ... You need to score a touch down mentally and you only have 7 seconds with no timeouts with 76 yards to go downfield. You need to get some sort of relief quick and you're willing to take a big risk to get it at this point. That is also GSC.   If you dont mind a chemically stinky harsh NUCLEAR MIND BOMB then GSC is definitely up your alley.   Not for the feint of heart. No it does not taste nor smell nor in any minuscule way resemble cookies. Not sure where that came from.",4,girl-scout-cookie
Danquest,"yo assuming this strain was a person and I was in a prison shower with this strain I'd have it's back.  I used to suffer from schizophrenia and such bad anxiety that I would shake in any social situated.

TretBoncassa,"Girl Scout Cookies, making connections in my reviews is something that I like to do to try and paint a picture of my own experience. With this strain, I found that I was constantly giggling at most things although not enough to make the people I was with annoyed. I feel that this is a quality strain to be smoking when with friends as your minds will bond like a covalent bond between atoms. The flavor and effects match the strength that of a race horse's muscles churning to the finish line, the speed of the powerful thoroughbred representing the speed of your mind while stoned off of this gorgeous strain. In a nutshell, excellence was achieved within this strain.",4,girl-scout-cookie

FloraFlowerLeaf,"After at least 4 doses via vaped flower (as I am writing this)....I am still able to write this post. I got hungry and ate half a block of cheese, caramel popcorn and butter toffee cashews. Definitely that sweet and salty craving. Iâ€™ll curse myself later after Iâ€™m bloated and canâ€™t shit. Not so pleasant side effect: I got that nasally drainage feeling like I was getting a cold, but I have had the same effect twice. I also just spent 15 minutes trying to figure out where the top of my bed sheet was.",5,girl-scout-cookie
Xenolightyear8900,Holy shit this is awesome. This strain is awesome because I feel good. I like the head high after three hits Iâ€™m feeling good. And whenever the pain comes back I will take another few hits. Because it is that good. Period :-),5,girl-scout-cookie
Angeleyez32225,Just tried it for my first time ... I'm only a couple of months MMJ patient. So there's a lot I still haven't tried..

Cazia,"Such a blissful head high. Makes your imagination run wildâ€” itâ€™s the perfect combination of head and body with the effects lingering in the head. This makes it a great strain for some â€œalone timeâ€ù. Hell if youâ€™re anything like me when I have this strain, you wonâ€™t even need to open your laptop or read any eroticaâ€” the one going on in your head is more than enough. No wonder it made â€œthe top five best sex strainsâ€ù.   (Not sure if it would affect men this way, I can only speak for the girls).   One of my very favorites~",5,girl-scout-cookie
lordrak,"Wow. What can I say... Very lovely hybrid. I just Vaped 2 fat hits off the Rove Cookies Cartridge. I am feeling great. No anxiety or paranoia. This is a great day time and night time strain. I would probably use this more toward the end of the day into night. I'm definitely high. My thoughts are wandering a bit but easy to control. This would make for a great vape/smoke right before meditation. I'm happy and feeling positive. No horrible cotton mouth but again, I only took 2 hits.  I give this 5 stars. Yum!

Listened to conversations. Hard time processing info to formulate words outta my mouth). A little of smoking flower goes a long way to get a high within 5-10 mins, to lasting 45 mins of a full high.

Ronfitpro,"Iâ€™ve been nervous to try this strain, because my wife doesnâ€™t like the way it makes her feel, and her and I seem to get almost identical affects from all of the different strains weâ€™ve tried. Our go to strains are Jack Herer or  Jilly bean to be social and up, and Gorilla Glue or King Louis OG for Netflix and chill.   I was given a nice size nugget to try by a friend who uses it to make brownies. I mainly use oil cartridges, so all I have available for dry is a small water bong.   I took two decent hits, and laid in bed on my computer working on a new ride and new music for spin classes that I teach, and I was laser focused, yet so chill.  Absolutely the perfect strain for picking a relaxing task to do.  The music sounded bright and clear and I could literally hear and feel every note. AMAZING!    Wife came home from having dinner with her girlfriend , and I was instantly ready to devour her. Sex is amazing on GSC!   This is a very well balanced hybrid. Iâ€™m hooked. I may even convince my wife to try it again, since the first time she had it, it was oil. ",5,girl-scout-cookie
Ashlio,"most versatile strain I've come across in my mmj ventures. dosing is key. microdose to get through your day stress-free, or really go for it for a good time. a solid 5 hits cures my migraine, any more and I'm straight to bed. beginners should take it easy.",5,girl-scout-cookie
slfisher70,Found it to be a head buzz. Overall body relaxation and good for pain management. Has helped with appetite considerably as it stimulates you to eat. Chips are dangerous- you can eat a whole bag. I get taste of pine earthy flavor. Not quite Mint. Not a strain for a novis I would say.,5,girl-scout-cookie

Blondie222,"I was introduced to GSC as Girl Guide Cookies, the Canadian equivalent to the USA. This is the best high for me - an energetic female, Leo/Tiger, whose name means Queen Bee. I have had the nickname Energizer Bunny growing up and still get called it at 57 (OMG that sounds old). I am in the construction business and GSC makes the pain go away and relaxes my shoulders and makes my life seem perfect. Highly recommend - enjoy!",5,girl-scout-cookie
wehowardjr,"I tried GSC for the first time today and absolutely love it.  Took only one deep hit and that was enough for my pain to ease up for quite awhile.  Very impressed with its effectiveness.  On a side note, it also helped with the floaters in my eyes.  They are gone, I'm sure temporarily, but at least I'm not seeing them shoot across my eyes for now.",5,girl-scout-cookie
Onionringpizza,Cresco Cookies LLR - This wasnâ€™t a favorite of mine. I usually lean toward sativas but enjoy an indicate occasionally too. The version I had left me really tired on the come down with a slight headache.  The high can be pretty strong if you take too many pulls. I was trying to adjust the temp on my battery and wound up taking about 5 pulls. That was too much for me and sunk me into my couch with side A of Led Zeppelin II on the turntable. Even though the pressing is pretty crappy I felt like I was right there in the audience.  After the side ended I got up to change the side and got very light headed and uneasy on my feet. This may be exactly what you are looking for but I don't like the feeling of loss of control of my body and will most likely avoid this strain on the future.  That record did sound good though!,3,girl-scout-cookie
Subpopsomething,Love GSC! This strain offers a great high that supports an energetic and talkative mindset. It's a great daytime smoke that creates a functional high. I feel clear and level headed when I use this strain. This does the trick when I have things to do or when I'm in an a group environment. I use the Trulieve vape pen and concrete and it's fantastic.,5,girl-scout-cookie

Newgrange,This is a top-notch strain for feeling energized and happy. I tried Cresco Cookies and was first blown away by how sweet the smoke was. Then: euphoria. The kind you hear about but rarely achieve. Almost a mild ecstasy vibe. Made me talk my ass off about utter nonsense. Probably smoked more than I needed the first time because I was happy and energized but also incredibly high lol! Would be great at a concert with friends. ,5,girl-scout-cookie

FutchAndCalli,"Weâ€™ve had this a couple of times and Iâ€™m just not a big fan.  Like most hybrids, it tops out at â€œgoodâ€ù. No real flaws, but nothing that really distinguishes it either. Itâ€™s just a mid range option that is decent for sex but nothing special. Moreover, there are so many different strains posing under this name that you really donâ€™t know what youâ€™re going to get as far as effects. The future of cannabis is consistency and predictability. Unless someone develops a consistent GSC that becomes the new standard, this strain is one to avoidâ€”despite its great name.   We are 50-somethings who vape and have sex pretty much daily. All our reviews focus on our experiences mixing cannabis and sex. We only rate after using an oz so the reviews give a well-rounded impression that captures a strainâ€™s potential, downsides, and typical effects. ",3,girl-scout-cookie
Jmed111,"The bud appeal was amazing 10/10, each bud was between 2-6g. The colours were vibrant green buds with dark brown pistils. The smell was a mix of cookies/cake and pine. The smoke was very smooth and tasty. The high felt like a a straight 50/50 hybrid, I enjoyed smoking this strain on my own whilst doing mildly physical activities. I felt a strong cerebral high within a couple minutes after consumption, this was accompanied by a mellow remaxation of the body.",4,girl-scout-cookie

Disabled_Veteran,"100% service connected PTSD veteran. This is one of my &quot;go to&quot; strains for relaxation and stress relief. GSC is more body than head and you can feel yourself physically and mentally relax. There's a decided euphoric - yet relaxed - feeling that permeates your body and mind. Like any veteran with my background and diagnosis, I don't sleep at night. GSC is a very effective hypnotic and helps me fall asleep more quickly when I finally do. The high is strong, but mellow; it's as if your easing slowly into a peaceful, serene hot tub.",5,girl-scout-cookie

Voytek55,"The Joe Montana of herb. Not only is it a champion among its brothers and sisters, but itâ€™s easily one of the most magical strains to have. Unequivocally an incredibly euphoric strain. If you are struggling through life, encountered a road block, or are in need of opening your heart again then gsc is your angel. Itâ€™s euphoric inducing trance is enough for me to give it a 5 and Iâ€™ll leave it at that. Utilize this strain as a medicine to heal you. Definitely too euphoric and useful for it to be social herb. Relaxes you very well, and i experienced no paranoid thoughts. But if you are a new psychonaut then omit your anxieties before smoking. Regardless, GSC will take you where you need to be.",5,girl-scout-cookie
Shadiya526,"So far so good! I vape this and recently bought it and itâ€™s the only strain so far to drastically numb out the pain I feel daily.

GirlScoutCookie421,"well, i just reached around me looking for the phone i was reading these reviews on... so, thereâ€™s that. This is a delightful, creative, and silly. Iâ€™ve been watching brainless sitcoms and writing for like twenty minutes. (of course â€œwritingâ€ù is surfing my apps). I feel it mostly in my face, around my eyes and cheekbones. It feels like this strain is grandma pinching your cheeks, but then thereâ€™s also the feeling of â€œoh, but Grandmaâ€™s pies!â€ù and everything is alright. Itâ€™s a loose focus. Like you allow yourself to go tangential but have no issue finding your way back to what you were thinking about. I mean, Iâ€™ve been writing this for 7 minutes. Itâ€™s a good and neutral high - I can sleep on it and I can work on it. Enjoy! *cookie emoji*",5,girl-scout-cookie
CaptainQuazar,"Girl Scout Cookies is as good as all the hype. My dispensary was sold out of the 8ths from Ilera,, so I purchased several grams before those were grabbed up. Unfortunately the buds tend to be smaller this way. Those small buds were densely packed and covered with lots of orange fuzzies. A very sweet aroma which produced a heavy vapor. Sweet and earthy flavor gave way to a very fast relaxing and tingly body buzz. A really nice state of euphoria without being edgy. I was able to go out and run some errands. Who ever said that cookies aren't appropriate for breakfast was wrong, GSC is a perfect way to start your day. Pairs well with AHS: Apocaplyse.",5,girl-scout-cookie

BakedFreshDaily,Girl Scout Cookies is a great strain. I stepped on a push pin while on GSC and had no idea it was in my foot until my wife pointed it out.

winterferret,"I really want to like GSC.  It has everything I need.   It helps with pain and inflammation, has slight sedative effects, and not too much head high.   But no matter how much I try to vape gently and on the lowest heat, I cough up my toes.   I actually have 10 to 15 minute coughing spasms after the lightest hit and my throat feels ripped to shreds after.    I've tried Trulieve's cartridges, MÃ_v's all in one vape pens (they call it Forum Cut Cookies), and flower with a pipe.  No matter what, shredded throat from coughing.   However, if I've got a migraine coming on and I'm away from home, Mimosa is the stain most likely to make it possible for me to get home safely.

No hang over from what I can tell. Maybe a slight mood lift in the morning. Not the uplifting smoke I love from pineapple kush. More of a knock out indica for bedtime.,2,girl-scout-cookie

OG_Heavy_D,"This works for me either way, if I want to sleep or if I want to be busy.  This is pretty potent stuff for sure.  I load up a chillum and take one good hit and I'm right where I want to be.  If I take another one it'll be lights out.  At 26% THC it hits hard but comes on slow.  I'm really enjoying this strain... right now, in fact.",4,girl-scout-cookie
Topagent,Give it a chance to kick in. Great balance and super smooth.,5,girl-scout-cookie
Stellar.D,This is an awesome strain! I usually lean toward more of an indica for evening use but tried it earlier in the day. I smoked a bunch thinking I was not getting high. It slowly creeps up on you. Left me feeling very happy and chill. I was still able to get stuff done but then relax when I was ready. Great strain! I will be buying this again!,5,girl-scout-cookie

yellowbigcat,the taste of gsc was very prominate in this live resin!!,4,girl-scout-cookie
musicrespons,Not my favorite strain but it was definitely a top 10. I tried a Bloom cartridge. They tend to be fruitier than other brands Iâ€™ve learned and this tastes great from them. Might be a different experience with someone else.   Puts you down fast and into an introspective mood.  ,4,girl-scout-cookie
Sumatrasu82,Great for getting focused. Great catch at Beyond Hello.,5,girl-scout-cookie
xsebrox,"I expected more of a desert tasting smoke but was still relatively pleased with the overall characteristics of the strain. Unfortunately, whoever grew this did not do a proper flush so the smoke was somewhat harsh and you could still taste nutrients within the bud.   The overall appearance was appealing with bright orange hairs and light green hue. I had the â€œBernerâ€™s Cookiesâ€ù variant of the strain (80% Sativa / 20% Indica) which produced an energetic effect that boosted creativity and productivity.   Overall, I enjoyed this strain. I wanted a little more flavor but it could have been lacking because of the growerâ€™s lack of flushing the cannabis at the end. I will be trying this again and possibly choosing this strain to grow.

BACONFLIPZ,"This strain has been in my top 3 favorite strains for years. In bud form, itâ€™s crunchy, super kiefy and tastes/smells delicious. Itâ€™s a smooth smoke as well. Iâ€™m currently vaping it right now and it has the same effects. Mellow, giggly, not a care in the world. It feels like the weight of the world is uplifted from my shoulders (even though I just woke up from an incredibly long nap) and when all is said and done, Iâ€™ll be too tired for anything to really bother me and Iâ€™ll cruise back into my bed for another great nap.

SafetyLast,"This classic came in small, dark green hairs with dark but bright orange hairs protruding from behind every tiny leaf. The smell is earthy, almost skunky in a sense. It tastes and feels like a sativa with some added benefits of indica. One of those benefits is the time-warping effect I've come to love from high powered indicas. It expresses it's sativa genes through a calm and clear mind, perfect for relieving stress and getting in a short workout. The last mentioned is a very rare effect for me.

TheOtherOne8w,"GSC is a very good strain if a buzzy head high is what you're looking for. The body effects were slim though. My thoughts were racing a mile a minute from one thing to the next but not in a bad way, just very mentally stimulating. After the initial high wore off I was left floating around in a cloud for the next few hours without the ability to give a fuck about about anything. It was a very welcome change from my overly anxious, OCD self. So yeah, I recommend GSC if you want something mentally stimulating but you'd do better looking somewhere else if a strong body stoned feeling is what you're after.",4,girl-scout-cookie

I love it, truly, and if it was all I could ever smoke, I'd die a happy and high fella. Peace to all. ",5,og-kush
flyguywill,"These nugs were dark and massive, fairly dense with a piney chocolate smell and covered in orange hairs and crystals. Overall it looked like the definition of DANK, very difficult to bust up too. But the high was something else, very uplifting and social buzz kicks in within a few minutes followed by euphoria and body buzz, powerful and very talkative high. A MUST TRY!! dont pass it up, its a beautiful strain!",4,og-kush
Anonymous,"I was diagnosed with ADD last year at the age of 19 and my life completely changed; unfortunately that included my ability to sleep. I've tried a number of pharmaceuticals to combat the late night effects of vyvanse (xanax and ambien to name a few), but they all just seemed to mess me up and still not do anything. I've been smoking for about 5 years but I never considered it as a sleep aid until about a month ago. After trying green crack, jack herer, bubba kush, cherry kush, and cheese (yes, I did figure out the difference between an indica and a sativa), I am completely settled on og kush. It's fast, hits hard, and leaves a unique numbness for hours. Absolutely perfect as a sleep aid. However, I would definitely recommed some sort of smell killer if you live with parents or un-apperciating peers. It can be quite...skunky.",4,og-kush
420IndigoChild,"For me and my girlfriend, smoking is a bonding experience. After each hit, I love talking with her, Whether it be about our day, us and our future, or life experiences or little things. This weed is GREAT for that, take your time with it, take a hit from the bong and let it take its course and fully hit you before taking another. Experience each kind of high. Each hit you take is a different high, so love it, stay in it, then tell it goodbye. This weed makes you very talkative and euphoric, just always make sure you smoke not upset. This weed is great to be open and intimate with. The only downfall is that it makes you so sleepy. Even after wake n bake, I want to go back to bed afterwards, and my body goes into hibernation mode. Save this for late at night, when the moon is in the sky just right, and you are ready to snuggle with the love, or the cats.",4,og-kush

petethekoala,"This review is an update of a previous review I made a few months ago about our famous OG Kush that many consider as the god of cannabis, especially here on the West Coast. I first rated this strain as a 4 because the reality is, because of it's fame, a lot of growers planted this seed but after that only cared about money and the name so they ended up on the shelves with a somewhat average to no good product. Since then I tried a lot of good quality products in this range of strains so I have to give it back it's 5 (4,8 to be exact). This is a great herb that gives you both a powerful body and head buzz. Had a very fun and creative trip most of the times I was on this one. In term of taste it's a kush taste so Earth, Sweet, Pine,  Wood blended so it' become a Hashish mashup with citrus and herbal notes. It's great for party, socials, artistic creativity and hiking. Kills pain instantly. It can go either for anxiety (get rid of social anxiety in my case). Just be cautious if you're a new cannabis user because too much can make you really anxious and paranoid (happened to a friend and myself I was a little anxious on this one once). Just control yourself and the flaws I mentioned won't happen or will be easy to control. Not for beginners. Simply some of the best weed you can get if you're grower really care about his or her trade!",5,og-kush

Josh135,"I don't know what it is about OG Kush and its ability to fight my pain. I have noticed that despite verying THC content in various bags over the past few years, it always calms my nerves and brings my pain to a level thats manageable.

mikeyinid,"Picked up a half O of OG Kush from a friend. It was not very good looking, mostly shake and leaves. Decided to make butter instead of kill myself smoking it. Decarbed it and simmered it for 3 hours then made snickerdoodle cookies bigger than my hand with the butter. Me and my GF split a cookie and I have never been more stoned in my life. I'm pretty well experienced in the edible department but these topped anything I'd ever had before.

The different flavors upon inhale and exhale are delicious and for first time in awile I'm super stoked to find a strain I've never tried , and enjoyed . 9.3/10",5,og-kush
GanjaGoddess410,"This is one of my all time favorite strains. Despite the fact that it's considered a Sativa dominant hybrid, I believe that it is much more Indica. The genetics are unknown, so I still believe that it's more Indica dominant.     This strain is a perfect example of a typical medical marijuana strain. For me, it helps with chronic Fibromyalgia pain, PTSD, PMS, insomnia, depression, anxiety, migraines, stress, etc.  It's a great strain for a variety of things. I wouldn't smoke it if you're trying to stay awake though.  It'll definitely give you some couch-lock, dry eyes, and dry mouth. But hey..are those side effects that bad compared to the side effects of prescription medications you could have prescribed for the problems I listed?     If you're looking for a silly, giggly Sativa high, I don't think you'll get it with this strain.     The buds are dense, and it has a very earthy smell, in my opinion. I would describe the scent as being like cinnamon, flowers, sweetness, and moss, all mixed together.     It's an extremely relaxing experience. I HIGHly suggest trying this strain.",4,og-kush
kurticus,Favourite strain. Long lasting high (almost 7 with a redose 30 mins after initial dose). Good taste. Heavy stone. Good for sleep. Helped with my AD/HD and Tourettes syndrome.  Can get pretty trippy. The king.  OG... Original Gangsta (:,5,og-kush
weazal,"SFV OG KUSH '88:  Wonderful come on! A warm, tropical tidal wave of euphoria carries you off oh so gently in it's embrace. Everything's soft, supple...literally feel embraced by a blanket. Soothing fuzzies cascade over your body. EVERYTHING feels good physically. The flawless, uplifted, and encouraging high would likely make sex down right transcendent.  Sound is easily the best I've ever heard (second maybe to Pre-98 Bubba Kush?). Music is so fucking rich and textured, hitting at ever level tactfully and emotionally.  Oh my good, this is exactly what acid feels like. Visuals are incredibly delayed/augmented (in a beautifully investing way). Quite nearly hallucinating here...  Haha, this is so fun! Mentally, TOTALLY GONE. Again, like acid, your head's in another place. Yet, there's a motivated energy that stays with you and keeps it uplifting. You will, unfortunately, get sleepy a little after halfway through. Not a negative crash, but a nap will sound SO GOOD.  This is your go-to high for shitty days. It's the equivalent of a loved one wrapping a big, warm blanket around you, erasing all your worries, and making you feel so happy and optimistic for the future. The kush element means it kicks ass for movies and music. Only downside is it can knock you out before you want it to - but that's indicas for ya.",4,og-kush
fangningsheng,"In my opinion, OG Kush is one of the standards that good cannabis should be measured by. OG is an incredibly well balanced indica dominant hybrid, with mellow, relaxing mental effects and a glowing body high. For me, OG is suitable for use almost anytime of day as it doesn't tend to over sedate me or make me paranoid or anxious unless I over-medicate. A classic, world-renowned strain that has certainly earned its reputation.",5,og-kush
UncleAcid,"An absolute classic strain, and a must try for those new to cannabis. Good strain to have in your medicine cabinet at all times!  Earthy, woody, piney and on occasion if you have the right phenotype, a little lemony. It hits fast and goes straight to your head, leaving one giggly, spacey, and  with a permanent grin plastered across their face.   Excellent for nausea, good for pain, GREAT for boredom or just hanging out. Good for any occasion really.  This is quite possibly in my top five favorite strains.

It isnt too fruity or piny - it is a great mix of the two and has no bad aftertaste, unless you burn it horribly and continue to smoke it. That's obvious though.    If you need help falling asleep, eating, laughing, or relaxing after work, pickup an OG.  It will always take care of you.  ",4,og-kush

In some cases it might mexican sativa any case its primo equator bud aka Sativa cross with an Indica from The Kush mountains (afghan, paki, thai, himalaya. I hope that clears some smoke.

DaddyGreenthumb,"OG is a phenominal strain. I'm a Combat Vet with PTSD and physical injuries, and I stand firm with this younger, but certainly not lesser, Kush strain. I sleep better, I'm not so depressed or anxious, which is nice considering I have a large family. They can always tell if I haven't (smoked) taken my medicine. My rehabilitation through the last 15 years has almost definitely been accelerated, and enhanced by this flower. My pain is so much better I can't feel it at all on most days, and my PTSD is manageable to a point that I have caught my wife's attention again, I'm being more social, and my 5 girls feel like they have their daddy back. I don't get the munchies that bad, but smoking 3 times a day, pretty well coincides with meal times and what's nice is I don't lose the effects after eating, however, a straight gorge session will leave you full, bloated, and sleepy.

Just one small nugget in a pipe, about 5 good hits and I was stoned for a good 2-3 hours instantly, but I'm fairly &quot;light weight&quot; when it comes to weed.   So, then I used it to make bud butter. (Boil water in a pot on the stove, put a glass bowl over the top of the pot face up. Put one stick of butter to every 3-4 grams of ground up weed into the glass bowl. Cook for at least 1/2 hour) I used the whole batch of bud butter to make 2 dozen chocolate chip cookies. I ate ONE cookie (plus licked the beaters after mixing) and I was seriously stoned for over 6 hours!   Ditching my pipe for good!

tripdog,"I am reviewing the outdoor version of this flower, obtained from 61eleven dispensary, the drive-thru collective in San Diego.    The appearance is a medium green with few visible brown/tan pistils. Trichome coverage to the naked eye is very light, but under a loupe they are more apparent. The smell is a prototypical earthy, spiced, kush-type smell. Smell-wise it is nowhere near as pungent as some of the indoor OG Kush I've had.    If I'm honest it doesn't have much &quot;bag appeal&quot; at all, but the &quot;taste&quot; and &quot;effects&quot; departments are where this bud REALLY shines.     This specimen when smoked, has a robust, flavorful and smooth smoke. It finishes very clean with almost no aftertaste. It's quite honestly one of the best tasting Kush's I've sampled to date.    What this particular OG Kush lacks in &quot;bag appeal&quot; it makes up for big time in the effects department. First, it is an extremely uplifting high that could be compared to that of a Sativa, but without any paranoia or racing thoughts. The effects are always predictable, a happy enjoyable high that is long lasting without being too &quot;couchy&quot; or demotivating. It does finish with a pretty heavy burn out so I can't fully recommend it for a daytime smoke.     ",5,og-kush

After just two deep inhales my entire body melted into a blissful state of weightlessness, my senses sharpened, my mind remained 100% alert, I laughed at something on the TV and the sound of my own laughter literally sounded foreign...it has been that long!

I was able to focus on the negative aspects to my personality but instead of getting down about it i was able to formulate a way forward to fix things, since that night 4 weeks ago i have apologised to my wife and thanked her for sticking around, become more active with the kids, have built bridges with my mum and in laws, I've stopped smoking, cut down on the drinking, started a healthy eating plan, fixed all the things around the house that i had neglected, not had a can't get out of bed all day moment once and enjoyed the best Christmas and New Years Eve in years, truly amazing strain with no paranoia, great for communicating and or properly chilling out on your own.

shelli5288,This is by far my new favorite strain. It tastes delicious almost like a woody vanilla with sort of sweet undertone. The smoke was a little harsh at first but it mellowed out after a few hits. The smell is really strong and has a sweet vanillaish earthy smell. The nugs are nice and dense and sticky and soft when its ground and when u crack them open there's so many crystals it looks like diamonds in your bud &lt;3 The high comes on quick and makes you forget all your worries. Probably the best smoke for depression and anxiety. I was so happy and talkative when usually I'm sort of antisocial. This bud kept a smile on my face and kept me giggling. The high lasts a pretty decent amount of time too. Only downside was bad dry eye but nothing visine didn't fix. Munchies were there but not insane.

It gives you a nice happy energetic talkative high. The only downside is that you will need to carry around a bottle of water or a pack of gum because it makes your mouth extremely dry.

Anonymous,"     Extremely good strain! A definite reason for the rage. The high is something different, an &quot;awake&quot; type indica (it is mainly sativa with indica in its heritage) that has the ability to both lift mood, moderately stimulate, awaken, but also give an amazingly euphoric body high, especially at higher doses. Puts me in just a happy, comfortable (both mentally and physically), content and interested state. Might I add, this strain is great with music. Music sounds especially fantastic and the creative jive of this bud come through during that activity, at least for me.         To add, it is long lasting without much comedown.          I did get a tiny bit of anxiety, though it was mild and extremely quick moving, more my own doing than the buds. Very mild, hard to truly feel a sense of anxiety with this bud, and you are put in a mindset to let it pass, not dread it. Was able to jump right into this bud, intaking large amounts, right away, without much issue.        Great bud, do not pass it up. Far exceeds its gangster heritage.",4,og-kush

highdefnition,"The one, the only. Often imitated but never duplicated, this has become notorious for good reason. So many guesses as to the lineage but imo id say something along the lines of Skunk (think RKS), Thai, Afghani (some type of hashplant?) or a mix of them. The full genetics we still don't know but Josh D and some others have come forward telling the tale of how she ended up in cali from florida and how it fell into the hands of b real and others in the hollywood circle in the late 90s (theogkushstory). OG does not mean ocean grown, if anything it means original but in the end it doesn't matter because it wont change what she is, its only a name. Whether its tahoe, ghost, sfv, hells angels, s.a.c , diablo, fire, legend, true, platinum etc. they are all some amazing genetics. Deep funky flavors of fuel, pine, redwoods, citrus, fresh tennis balls, wet dog, burnt popcorn, new rubber bands, and other weird thiols and terpene profiles are found here in great nuance. I believe this to be the reason, along with the high tolerance threshold, why the effects appeal to all sorts of people's endocannabinoid systems.

Yes there are MANY forms of OG KUSH, BUT, EVERYBODY (Master growers, true connisuers, lineage experts, etc..) knows that the original OG kush which BTW the &quot;OG&quot; stands for &quot;ORIGINAL GENETICS&quot;, NOT ORIGINAL GANGSTER, OR OCEAN GROWN, or any other stupid things I've seen ppl say it means. Please ppl keep in mind that this strain originated here in the 90's and it started out as a very simple cross; (Lemon skunk x Hindu kush). After about 6 yrs or so of this strain taking the cannabis world by storm, ppl decided to start adding to those genetics to make more super strains, for example SFV OG kush which is (chemdawg x lemon THAI x Hindu kush). By adding Chemdawg and changing the original lemon SKUNK to lemon THAI added a much higher sativa effect as Thai is a pure sativa and skunk is a hybrid which added a more powerful sativa effect along with adding Chemdawg to the mix made this a whole new OG kush pheno and so on and so forth. This has caused ppl to assume that the original OG kush had chemdawg in it and no skunk, but thai instead which is totally wrong. The original OG kush was meant to be a hybrid that is sativa dominant.",5,og-kush

EcoBGreen,"OG Kush is one of the consistently - noticeably stronger highs on the market.  It is so good many rappers in the Atlanta area - go out of their way for anything with OG in the title - because they get blown away by the strength of different blends. And it is hard to beat the Oregon/Original Ghost Kush - OG Kush - stinky, funky, even a fruity/cheesy taste and room filling smell.  It is easy to get so high you temporarily get stuck in your head.  Snoop Dogg &amp; Friends in LA are outspoken about the OG Kush hardcore party weed vibe. Red Dragon, however, is moving toward becoming the &quot;it&quot; weed, now.  While OG Kush gives you a powerful stoners rush - Red Dragon gives a super long THC mind altering experience that would be good for both creative artists or partiers going to a music concert.  It alleviates anxiety, allows for focus, so you can enjoy whatever you are doing while on it.  Aphrodisiac quality - a super sexy high - with an exotic guava fruit taste and smell. If you want to test yourself on being able to handle your weed - the only thing currently that takes it to the next level has OG Kush as a grandchild of a cannabis strain development effort -called Elektraslide.  When it comes to pushing cannibinoid levels Elektraslide is a freak offspring plant from Holy Grail Kush and SAGE - both in the top 5 strongest weeds tested potency in the world.  Lemon, chalky, alien haze goes down smooth, but expands in the lungs quickly.  It takes down even the most advanced or experienced smoker.  The THC is stratospheric, but so is the CBD, and CBN numbers.  The Holy Grail Kush had two of the highest cannabinoid levels in being Kosher Kush x OG Kush.  The incredibly high THCa content comes from SAGE pushes the complimentary THC genetics even higher than previously thought possible.  Gives a highly tingly body rush with electric currents racing over the skin, if over half a pin joint is smoked.  It also tends to lock a person down, while doing the above.  Elektraslide is still not in the commercial market.  Got a taste from an underground Atlanta connection.  Most memorable smoke in the last 30 years.  My guess is that it could probably help someone who is dealing with pain in the right dosage.",5,og-kush

Tonight was one of the highest i have ever gotten, and the buds are VERY compact, probably half an inch tall &amp; wide, and i had gotten this for the first time tonight, $40 worth. but 2 of those tiny nugs filled my .5g bowl. very dense, and extremwly potent.

organicsarcasm,"Super stoked to have this again, I've been smoking on this off and on for around a month now. It's definitely got that 'bang for your buck' factor to it, it has that truly unique stank to it that lets you know it's the real OG kush. Taste is great, a skunky-kushy taste that sticks around for up to 30 minutes which really surprised me. The high is super long lasting and it takes little to nothing to get you lifted. The buds are glittery with trichomes and have a very nice light green-dark green pattern to them [almost. maybe if you squint.] This is an all around great smoke, I prefer the heavier indicas to most strains, this is right up my alley, so to speak.",4,og-kush
StillSmokin59,"I've been living with chronic pain for over 10 year's due to Fibromyalgia, Degenerative disc disease and a  few  other maladies of old age and I'd been precribed just as many different pharmacuetical medications over that time, including opioids. One year ago December I decided I'd had enough of the pills and their side effects and stopped EVERYTHING, cold turkey. I attribute my success of weaning myself off ALL medication to this strain, OG Kush!!! It's ability to crush pain, stress and depression and not put me in couch-lock is what has saved me from the drugs my doctor's INSISTED would &quot;help me&quot;! So if you're dealing with pain, depression and anxiety, (they tend to go together), I highly recommend you try OG Kush, I don't think you'll be disappointed!",5,og-kush
team-atlantis,"Dense, heavy sticky bud with an earthy smell, and very heavy smoke to hit - it even makes us cough when vaporized. It takes a lot of concentration and finesse to smoke it gently without coughing hard. Other strains are a piece of cake to smoke after this.   Those heavy hits come on slowly - take your time on your first few tries of the OG Kush - you might actually end up even more stoned (versus that sativa mental &quot;high&quot;) than you expected. It really feels like a warm blanket wrapped around you as your muscle tension just melts away.",5,og-kush

spacejunkOG,"&quot;Sativa-like effects&quot;. . . . . not in most OG's.  And let's be honest you really have no clue what kind of genetics of the new OG (_insert cool name_) Kush you just bought, especially if you're here in Cali where the Kush craze is literally a joke at this point.  OG Kush may as well just be a synonym for good weed, like Chronic or Skunk, other strains that just became synonymous with &quot;good weed&quot; via rap and media.  OG Kush is essentially a strain with hundreds of different phenotypes and sub-crosses that all act a bit differently.  (Tahoe OG,Alien OG,Yoda OG,SFV OG,Ferrari OG,Bentley OG,Fire OG,Cherry OG, and on and on and on) And the only people who really know the genetics are the people who have been holding mother plants since the early 90's.  OG's are constantly falsely labeled, because they all smell so similar and people can get away with mis-labeling strains or just plain making names up.  For me?  They put my ass to sleep.  Pretty much all of them, unless they're crossed with a proper Sativa.  But it's great potent weed when you need something to put you to sleep. I don't know how people smoke kush all day.",4,og-kush

deadlightbulb,"_Ÿç‹_ŸŒ_ O.G. Kush is like eating the best homemade chocolate chip cookie Grandma could ever dream of baking. Once you try it, other strains will always be compared back to this one. Truly a classic, the cerebral effects are consistent and amazingly beneficial. I consider O.G. Kush to be an anytime strain, as it simply does it all. Once you know what a true O.G. smells like, you will always want it! The smell is a lemony, piney punch to the face with the really sharp notes of wood. I absolutely love all of the phenotypes of O.G. The best one I ever had is called UNCS O.G. I cannot find any information on it but it is fantastic.

Stonezmovement,"I am here to give the TRUE AND REAL HISTORY OF OG and am ready to let people know where a lot of these big power strains came from. OG Kush is not an indica or sativa it is an Afghanica it is something entirely different. Since America has been going into Afghanistan for war heavily in the past 15 years we have been seeing a lot of kush strains and people have been curios where they came from. It's our Military! Yup those goof ol boys are bringing home seeds from the crops they raided and coming home to serve up delicious crops from this heavy resin producing new group of cannabis the THE STRAINS IN THE AFGHANICA FAMILY ARE (in order and grouped by scent); All the kushes (minus OG that's in the gas family of Afghanica),now the gases are; OG kush Chem dog, Headband, and Sour Diesel, the next are the sugarey smelling but still very resinous afghan goo, and hash plant. Jorge Cervantes wrote the Grow Bible and explains Afghanicas. It is a real thin CANNABIS GROWS ON EVERY CONTINENT EVERYWHERE THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT WEED IT ADAPTS TO ITS ENVIRONMENT AND THE THINGS AROUND IT PLEASE SHARE THIS. I'm sure some dead heads helped spread the seeds but it was the men from war bringing what they raided home and that'd a fact thank the Afghan and Iraqi people for producing generations of higher and higher resinous hash and oil producing pot with incredible medical benifits",5,og-kush

immaliveforever,Iâ€™ve smoked this strain for awhile and by awhile I mean probably about 4 or 5 ounces of this specific strain in the past year. I really never get tired of it. This Old head of a strain punches like a grown ass man. I love to use it in blunts to myself when I wake up. It gives me a great head rush with out the overly energizing effects that makes some people paranoid. At the same time it assists with my rheumatoid arthritis with ease which also makes this a great night time strain. Closing my eyes in bed and laying back with Mac Miller in my ears and OG Kush in my lungs makes me feel like everything is good for now you know? I guess thatâ€™s how it is right now at least.

It seems like you're floating above your physical form, observing calmly rather than interacting in order to achieve  different understanding of my surroundings. Everything makes total sense from up here, my love.  But not everything is good up her. My eyes are dry and swollen, my mouth dry and tacky. It is the expense we pay for the deeper understanding. My ears are confusing where sounds are coming from, which is giving me a strange feeling in my ear canals.  A good strain if you're prepared, much like going on a picnic at the beach.

I like that even after the high fades I still stay positive for another two hours. Itâ€™s a type of relief I never get to experience otherwise, including on meds.

I used a delivery service this time, my renewal date fell on a Sunday, so I thought I'd give them a try to fill the gap. So I can't tell you who the growers were, but the buds and packaging was very professional.   I think this latest batch should be renamed, OMG Kush, because it is just absolutely top notch, in all aspects. The scent is sweet, fragrant, and earthy all at the same time. Smoking it, you get a sweet, candy like flavor, and a smooth draw. Here's the thing, as an experienced consumer, my tolerance level is high, but this strain just really exploded, and gave a great lift.

kastour,"I picked up some OG Kush the other day and decided to try it out tonight. Being a lightweight and this being a new strain to me, I smoked a very small joint (.1g) to myself after a walk to a nearby convenience store (1-2 minutes from home) and then went home. I felt the effects almost immediately - after a minute or so of walking I felt what some may describe as a body buzz (I'm not super experienced so I'm not sure if that's what this was) I felt very light, as if I was walking on a cloud or just floating. It didn't cause me to stumble or anything, and I made it home fine.  I walked in about 5 minutes after finishing my pinner, fiending for the pomegranate that I had prepared before leaving in anticipation of getting the munchies. Unfortunately, my mom asked me to help her with the laundry unexpectedly, so I went straight to the basement and started sorting hangers and folding hot towels from the dryer. Among the metal wire hangers and couple wooden ones was this weird matte-plastic hanger that really tripped me out when I touched it. The feeling of it seemed so unnatural to me that I actually stopped and asked my mom to feel it and tell me if it felt weird (she said it didn't). The towels were fresh from the dryer, so they were pretty hot, and they made my hands/fingers tingle as I was folding them. By the time I'd finished the laundry, it'd been about 20 minutes since I finished smoking. Just as I finished, the thought of a cucumber popped into my head for no reason, and the taste filled my mouth. I could imagine it so vividly that on my way up to my room I grabbed an entire cucumber and brought it upstairs to eat with my pomegranate. I devoured the cucumber, ate the entire bowl of pomegranate, then ate the half bag of chips that was sitting on my computer desk, along with a litre of Pepsi. I then frantically ran around my house desperately looking for more food. It's about time to go grocery shopping, so the house is pretty much dry. I found a stray package of cookies with 5-10 left, killed those, and then gave up on my search.  I spent the rest of my night playing video games (League of Legends), telling a close friend of mine how important she was to me and that she was gorgeous after she asked me how I thought of her looks when I mentioned that another friend told me to try and date her after seeing some of her pictures. I was really affectionate and at the same time really enjoying my League matches, playing with her and a few other friends. That consisted of the next few hours of my night, and I'm here about 5 hours after that joint very satisfied with my high.  I had a short spurt of anxiety (I'm diagnosed with panic disorder, so finding good strains of weed is tricky) but it went away quickly. Other than that, I have no complaints. I recommend this strain, if and only if you have sufficient food because the munchies I got from this weed was ridiculous.",3,og-kush

SpanishGuitarist,"The term OG is nebulas at best. The roots of hybrids from the past 30 years are amalgamated into &quot;OG&quot;. But that is where it all begins. Having Thai, Columbian, Mexican and Afghani roots is a mix of phenomes, terpenes, and especially effects that can dominate the Indica spectrum with Sativa highlights. But depending on the cultivar, it can be the perfect mix.  Recently in NorCal we have seen &quot;Pure Kush&quot;, and &quot;OG&quot; become perennials. The Chemdawg roots from Landrace Varieties permeates the lineage, but the cultivar can use this a their palette to accomplish new levels of Cannabis.    Because of the years of breeding for stability, these days cloning OG to any strain produces a great result. And why not... The early Sativas were flowereing too long for non-tropic environments, and OG is the magical generic root for a great prodect; it does not need a long flowering time where results are possibly limited.  But the Sativa/Indica ratio can be altered easily. So now what about OG?   In NorCal, it is a cult favorite in its purist form. Simply speaking, This is the recreational favorite for those who love hybrids that are &quot;Old School&quot;. You will feel happy, but not wasted!",4,og-kush

I always wake up from the pain. For me I'll be taking 2 puffs from my pen and my pain in my joints is amazingly controlled. So I'll start doing this every 4-6 hours. And did I mention that it tastes delicious. I love the earthy flavor. Highly recommended.,5,og-kush
Y2Kween,Completely relaxing. Gave me major munchies then put me out to bed. Great strain for insomnia.,5,og-kush

TheLitch,Now I'm more used to vaporized cannabis because I use it to treat PTSD but I decided to go with this for a little bit of fun on my birthday. This is the cleanest tasting flower I've ever smoked. It was really pleasant and not dirty at all. It comes on quick and has a an incredibly heavy feel. I had to go lay down and sit it off a little because I wasn't used to it. But over all I'd say it's incredibly effective at relaxing the body. Come to think of it I actually had a bit of trouble feeling my body it was so strong.,4,og-kush

JustBreathe100,"My roommate brought a few grams home of OG Kush oneday, it had such a danks smell so I had to try it! Loaded a bowl before bed, put on a show on Netflix and wow I could feel it relax my body so good. The high is amazing and definitely one of my favorite strains!",5,og-kush
EverWeed,"I loved this strain both flower form and concentrate. The smell is really pleasing, with sweet and subtle smell of pine. The high made me feel really happy, really kicked my medical symptoms, and gave me an overall wonderful body and head buzz. Whats unique about this strain too is that it accommodates the time of the day! Either you need a great wake up call with energy or help falling asleep.I would highly recommend this strain to people who suffer depression, anxiety, chronic pain, who just want to make their day really awesome and happy, and/or just keep tossing and turning in bed at night.",5,og-kush
productivepothead_,"This strain has me and my friend glued to the earth rn. Iâ€™m relaxed.

Rhanex,"OG Kush is one of the most well-known and popular (highly potent) hybrid strains on the market. But, surprisingly, its lineage has been a closely guarded secret (or, rather, given its origins, no one can say conclusively). Nonetheless, many people (â€œin the knowâ€ù) believe OG Kush is a cross between the hybrid Chemdawg and legendary pure-Indica landrace strain, Hindu Kush. Because â€œallegedlyâ€ù (it could be stoner legend), OG Kush originally came from bag seed at a Grateful Dead show (back in the early 1990s), its lineage remains unconfirmed.  OG Kush produces consistent effects: a well-balanced head and body high, complemented by with intense euphoria and cerebral sensations. OG Kush passionistas claim a few puffs will leave you in a mellow, trance-like state. And, often couch-locked (which could be a good or bad thing, depending on what your preferences are.",3,og-kush
ChrisOtto420,"Iâ€™d be downgrading this strain if I gave it any less than 5 stars. My first experience smoking OG kush was by far the best high Iâ€™ve had to this day. As soon as I sparked the joint I felt just this buzz all throughout my body, and by the time I finished, the world around me was more beautiful than it had ever looked before, almost as if I was standing in a peaceful cartoon town. As the high peaked (I was walking during the whole experience) with every step, my body felt lighter and lighter and my spine had a strange tingling sensation that ran throughout my whole legs, and the more I walked the more I felt as if I would just lift off the the ground and float away. As the day went on the amazing feeling from this OG kush stayed with me for surprisingly a significant amount longer than any other weed Iâ€™ve had, and even after it did wear off my legs felt extremely light for hours after. OG kush to this day is the best strain of weed I have ever tried, and would highly recommend it to any stoner reading these reviews. _Ÿ_Ÿ",5,og-kush

ChillWizard,"One of my deserted island strains for sure. It hits me pretty strong and fast without any wondering if I need another hit or not. Relaxing and uplifting with a generally hypnotic stone in both my mind and body. Buried alive. I have some difficulty talking which is good because I talk too much anyway. I'd rather stagger into the silent stone zone anyway, but you can still navigate life if you need to, but it tends to shorten my social interaction if talking to regular people who aren't high, because I am still aware of how freakin' baked I must appear. This is a good thing for me.  Also, after smoking this for a few weeks straight I never built up any tolerance to it, so the same amount got me just as high, time after time, day after day. That's pretty rad. ",5,og-kush
ActualFactual,"In distillate form; was recommended for night-time use and pre-sleep medication to aid with insomnia, restless leg syndrome, restlessness, etc.  The cartridge I have specifically states &quot;Indica&quot; and I do believe there are 2 OG Kush varietals (at least!!) out there - one a hybrid, the other a dominant Indica.  Regardless, interesting medicine.  With the distillate, one long haul is usually measure enough to ascertain potency and effect.  In the case of this strain, it felt very familiar at the onset - definitely not as relaxing and numbing as a strong Indica - but it was relaxing and calmed my body down nonetheless.  However, I did lay in bed for a good hour enjoying the head-trip, then slowly started to enter a sleep-state, then, as though someone suddenly stopped the movie reel; it was LIGHTS ON and I was up!!  Seems as though when this stuff wears off, it perks you up.  Least it did last night, we'll try again tonight.  Anyway - after a weird moment I took another small hit off the cartridge and made my way back to bed where I did awake this morning, not as well rested as I'd hoped for, but I'm off to bed again now.  As for the product - chemmy aftertaste but that's typical with distillates in my vaping experience.  It's a solid narcotic feeling strain, I can see it worked well in calming my body, my mind not so much.  Let's see what tonight's experiments hold!!  Decent.  Strong, good on the body, introspective, efficient and potent, relaxes the muscles for sure, dry mouth which dissipates after about an hour.  ***UPDATE:  Tried again for night time use; seems this strain - while narcotic in its feel and effect, isn't the best night time sleep aid as, say, GDP or Blue God are.  Still decent enough for a calming body effect, but not so much to be lights out material.  Enjoyable nonetheless, just not knock-out material for sleep.  Will be trying G13 and a couple other Indica dominant distillates for sleep and will report back my findings***",4,og-kush

Not a great strain for getting a lot done, but for kicking back and jamming on some music or talking about movies, OG Kush is the king.   No bad side effects from Ogk either.

Kelz42069,_Ÿ”¥_Ÿ”¥_Ÿ˜__Ÿ˜__Ÿ˜‹_Ÿ_—_Ÿ˜_ What else is there to say about this strain ?? Growers use this 1 as a parent strain to other hybrids for good reason. The buds aren't impressive looking as some other strains can be with trichomes coating the flowers and potency thc % but we all should know each strain is enhanced by its terpene profile and I would take OG Kush over many of these other newer strains derived from OG kush parent. Chemdawg would be another hybrid  that I would say that about. Hybrid or not really. Both are top 5 overall.,5,og-kush

I was extremely paranoid that the police were outside my house based on absolutely no evidence (underage at the time) and the weed was so dank and so foul-smelling my roommates were pissed for bringing it into the house. Straight up skunky. I became extremely anxious and stayed under my covers too stoned to move for the entire high. I even had some auditory hallucinations, which I still to this day have never experienced with other strains. I heard voices, water running and crickets - none of which were actually there. I know OG Kush is a fan favorite for most but I personally don't recommend it at all, especially for those who have anxiety or a family history of mental health issues.",1,og-kush

Rollo.D,Not a lot to say about the strain itâ€™s ol reliable. If your looking to get high itâ€™ll get you there and for me the effects tend to differ depending on my mood and the situation Iâ€™m in. So if your at a party passing a blunt then youâ€™ll probably feel more happy giggly and stuff but if your chilling at home smoking a good night bowl then itâ€™ll probably calm you down a bit and Mike you relaxed.

Both times shit smelled of this beautiful, resiny pine, leaves SO much keef if you grinding.  Beautiful, beautiful highs. Absolute epitome of sensory experience after weed use, I remember one time I had headphones in while I was smoking and I didn't wanna take em out that whole night. I was deadass dancing in these elaborately choreographed music videos down in my basement like a fucking loon, but it's seriously the best.  A bit harsh on my throat, but that's not new (my lungs ain't shit), had all the confidence in the world and every sense was electrified (not to mention it made me super horny). Beautiful experience honestly, I could get used to smoking this daily.",5,og-kush
alexjonesisascooter,"This is a really good strain but it depends on what you want, earlier today I was at my local skatepark shredding shit up and before I skated I smoke a joint with OG Kush in it and itâ€™s one of those strain that makes you do everything really slowly and everything seems slower, itâ€™s not exactly super euphoric it just fucks with you so I would recommend this to an experienced stoner but for sure not for someoneâ€™s first or even 20th time ",4,og-kush

QueenDelJackson,"First impression: Sweet greeny naturery smell. Orange strains, fluffy buds. Great flower  Consumption: Placed in an average hand bowl and lit with a BIC lighter. Lit on outside by edge. Boy did this burn nicely. With the first light 3/4ths of the bowl was burned. It burned slow but every time I went in to clear the chamber, the flame gently traced into the bowl. Burned very nicely  Reaction: i have a pretty high tolerance but I feel alot higher than I usually. feel. I just found out this is a hybrid I thought it was an indica. My body is definitely heavy. My mind is clear. I often get slight paranoia but my mind is pretty sloth.   This is definitely one of my favorite initial highs, and i'm pretty sensitive to effects of weed. Really enjoyable relaxing high.",4,og-kush

JotaroFloyd,"I'm gonna give this a 4 star for only one reason (would be a five star otherwise): my fucking sinuses clog up like a motherfucker on this shit. But other than that, I feel happier, and I keep thinking of many different voices in my head and I keep kinda hallucinating. Listening to Crunch Time by Chris Travis (fucking SESH!) is a great experience. I feel like a million things could happen right now, but I also feel like sleeping a bit because my eyes are dry and I'm so fucking relaxed. Unfortunately, PSN was having maintenance at this time, so I wasn't able to sit down and play something like Human Fall Flat or Dead By Daylight. But food tasted really good and I wanted a flat iron steak. The shit itself tastes like grass clippings and diesel (I'll call it a Lawnmower taste), which isn't bad to me, in fact it's rather pleasant.  If you want the good shit and the summed up statistics, here you go:  Good for: boredom, stress, insomnia, lack of appetite, jacking off, sitting around, watching YouTube, playing video games, whatever the fuck honestly unless you're looking to be energetic physically rather than mentally.  Bad for: Being active physically and trying to get hot, cold or comfortable. Usually it just stays as one feeling of the three, and I'm COLD.  So yeah, definitely a would do again and it feels great.

kajohe,"I have not tried the Kush. I did buy Snow Ghost. If I understand this correctly, this is a single parent of Ghost. Most strains I look up have two parents. I need to be educated on how this happens. Not to be a smart allic, but to understand. I am experimenting right now for neuropathy issues. Terpeintines, you type about what it does for the flavor and what not. But not a word on turpentines and their interaction with pain relief. Or, if I missed it please show me. I would apologize for that. In the meantime, while all of this started in what 2010, then a couple of years back for Arizona. I see room for growth of knowledge on these web sites, pertaining to percentages more often than not. Available testing results, which turpentines, describe, and how much. Unfortunately, what I can see; what is happening, try, try, try. Till we find an average one that will work. Oh, the dispensary sold out. Start the process over. I encourage interaction about how I determine my body's needs for the relief of neuropathy. Our State is making buckets of money. Probably eighty percent of the prescribing Doctor's pay per person. Are they doing anything to help this along? or just collecting the money, on that, the sales and/ or taxing of, building regulations and licensing. What am I missing? Maybe put them to work and start paying for all these taxes and fee's by coming up with the information? Have a great day. I am trying Treasure Island today. fourteen/ fourteen on THC and CBD.

,Gg4 (Original Glue) Reviews,,
chronicallymedicated,"Initial impression: My bud-tender said in the usual tone &quot;what'll it be?&quot; I chirped back, &quot;surprise me, something new from the cannaseur shelf' please&quot;. So I was handed a newer strain aptly named &quot;Mother's Milk. The other one was Gorilla Glue #4 (GG)&quot; (reviewed in this post). Needless to say, I was pretty excited about both of these. I sampled this one in a pre-rolled cone form, also rolled with &quot;Raw Cones&quot; thanks to the talented hands of Jazzy J at Medicine Man's Medical Market, located in Glendale, CO.  I use a scale of 10 points, 10 being the highest possible score in any category, with 3 total categories, Taste / Aroma / Potency.  Aroma: 10.0 (+1.) bonus. This is the highest number of points I have ever awarded any strain for its aroma. The smell from this strain is so unique, I have never smelled anything like it ever. It had an incredibly strong pungent earthy aroma, with overtones of powerful industrial ammonia. Damn, is all I can really say about this strain. Kudos to the growers for this strain, really, it is something special. I would not want to grow a bunch of this indoors, you would need some serious filters, it would smell like a huge uncleaned litter box, in terms of a real strong odor of cat piss.  Taste: 9.5 The taste of this bud was something quite different than its scent. Like the aroma, the taste was also heavy. I was glad that the taste of this did not overwhelm me like its aroma. The initial taste of this is more earthy and piney than its smell leads you to believe. Regardless, this is by far the tastiest strain I have had aside from Jenny Kush in quite a while. It was intense, and mellow at the same time. Really a wonderful strain, with lots to offer.  Potency: 9.0 The strength of this euphoria was intense. This strain has provided me with one of the more intense body and head highs of any strain that I have reviewed to date. The high came on almost immediately, and was pretty intense in terms of its psychedelic intensity, the body high was great also, I felt lethargically focused, if that makes any sense. I was in full effect of the indica part also, and here is what I mean. I needed a seat belt for reality, but I was intensely focused on the movie I had on, &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;.  Final opinion: I thought this strain was really really great! The potency was strong, the aroma was powerful and the taste was exceptional, this is a textbook example of perfection. Great job to all of those involved in the production and distribution of this awesome strain. This strain when they have more will be in my private stash for the really long snow days we get in Denver. I would implore you (the reader) try this strain if you have the means to, it is absolutely worth it.  Total points awarded: 29.5 out of 30 (plus 1 bonus point in the aroma category). I would rate this strain 5.0 stars, I feel that this strain deserves every point it earned! This is not a strain for novices.  CM~",5,original-glue
MZ_PHD_in_420,"SOON TO BE TOP !0 STRAIN OF ALL TIME!!!I have 40+ years experience growing and using cannabis, a masters degree in agri/horticulture from MSU and will break each review down as follows from my own personal experience with seeds or clones obtained directly from the original breeders. I received my clone directly from the person that entered it in the 2014 Michigan High Times Cannabis Cup, where it won for the second time taking 1st place.  -USE: Hands down one of the best strains around and will soon be on the lists of the best strains of all time. One of the reasons it is so good is because it is the perfect combination of everything, Indica, Sativa, THC content, taste, smell, it's the perfect strain. It's really good for everything and can really be used all day long. I'm not even going to describe anything like effect, what it's good for, taste or potency because you can just fill them all in. The taste is amazing and like everything else, hard to describe because it like walking in a flower shop and asking what flowers you smell. All of them!!LOL    -GROW: If you can get you hands on an actual cut, than there is nothing better both indoors and out. Easy to grow, great yield, mold resistance and not to long of a lowering time. Keep in mind that this strain was created by self pollination so you can expect to find hermies and seeds but they are few and far between and shouldn't bother anyone because the end product is so good. Indoors the average finish time is 9-10 depending on the amount of light used. Outdoor: at 42*N latitude it could be picked on Oct. 1st but optimum time is Oct. 10-14th.  NOTE: GG4 is pretty easy to spot if you have an actual cut because it's final appearance is pretty unique. Both before picking and after drying the flowers have very few noticeable pistols/red hairs. They just look like large calyx's, covered in heavy trichomes, probably the stickiest stuff I have ever seen, hence the perfect name!",5,original-glue

purpleurklealienchempantsdogkush,"Bee's Knees? Cat's Pajamas? Although these are incredibly accurate, they do not come close to encompassing my view on Gorilla Glue.  When sir Smokes-a-lot gets a pound of Mr. Nice Guy's sweetest cheeba, he immediately notes how he can &quot;smell it through the bag, baby&quot;.  Well, if you're within 10 yards of this flower, your sense of smell will be climaxing from the sweet piny spice of those little green buds that you just wanna shove them in your mouth and eat them so much, awwwww CRAP........I just licked my computer screen......The effects are unreal chill, and take away my chronic back pain.  In fact, sometimes I feel like it takes my back away completely.  The sativa effect is most noted in my experience starting out pretty heavy.  I noticed this when I was in the bathroom upstairs in my office, of which my wife has been trying to get me to keep the door shut (even when no one is in there).  Her solution to get me to remember?  To booby trap me with a computer keyboard outside the door, so I would trip and remember to close the door.  Not the coolest thing she's ever done, but very effective.  I got to thinking, I'm 35 and I remember getting in trouble for messing with the family Apple IIe without permission because my parents thought I would break it somehow.  And those things were indestructible, I mean I'm pretty sure I remember having an entire dinner plate firmly inserted into the floppy drive at one point, and that didn't even void the warranty.  Nowadays, technology has apparently become so advanced, and electronics have become so common that we are willing to use their components as booby traps to teach our spouses lessons, so we can hopefully save a few cents a month on our electric bill.   As I sat there pondering this after inhaling the beautiful pharmaceutical knows as &quot;Gorilla Glue&quot;, it occurred to me - This stuff was 100% legit.  Not the inconsiderate type of weed that we all smoked in high school because it was the best stuff around at the time.  You know, the kind where you're headed out with friends so you pack a bowl at your buddy's parents' house who were out of town before you go out for the night.  Then once you're stoned and ready to leave, you gotta wait on your buddy to finish his turkey sandwich, then you start to  wish you had snuck another hit or two in the rotation because you're already starting to come down and get the yawns.  NO, GG#4 is the kind of considerate weed that holds the door for your mom, texts you on your birthday, and if you spend the night and fall asleep on the couch early - covers you up with a blanket so you don't wake cold.  GG hangs with you for the perfect amount of time - doesn't cut out early like your buddies after you have a party at your place who conveniently have to leave right before clean up time.  No, GG is there for you.  Making sure you are taken care of.  Until it lets me down, it's my go to strain.   Taste - UNREAL Smell - OFF THE CHARTS Effects - TOTALLY KILLER What more are you really looking for?  If you want something that will put you to sleep, this isn't it.  If you want something that will give you a full body buzz and no cerebral euphoria, try knocking on some Indica's door, because this gift from God will take you to some untouched realms of your internal psyche and you'll be better for it.  But as Lavar Burton used to tell me after Reading Rainbow, - You don't have to take my word for it.",5,original-glue
calebargh,"I smoked this strain off and on for a few weeks, I am currently high on this strain. I'm a 35 y/o male, mainly portuguese descent with some American Indian (Native American), and a small mix of others. Type O- blood. I was in a fasted state for 16 hours (Intermittent fasting 8/16) when I smoked some. I started cooking breakfast about ten minutes later, I was slightly agitated prior to smoking and now feel calm, but not out of it. As I was making breakfast I started to cook more, and more. I ate two eggs, french toast, andouille sausage link, 1 cup of blueberries, and was able to finish the entire meal due to the great munchies effect. I feel good, not too up, or too down, but I do feel like relaxing. I'm going to try smoking an equal amount and finish this after about 10 mins or so.   I'm back, I took a little more than the first, which I took about two inhales compared to one inhale off a quarter of an average bowl. If you read my other reviews you can compare my moods and see that this one makes me feel more uplifted, but not so much euphoric. I definitely feel the right side of my brain being activated more now that I'm about 15-20 mins out. The second high kicked in - heavy eyes, relaxed muscles, slight chair lock, brain function has declined now, lol, I feel like I'm forcing my brain to concentrate. No negative side effects so far. You can clearly see the difference between dosing a slight amount, and dosing a heavy amount, whereas my larger, second amount is more of what most people describe as the effects of gorilla glue. You could possibly use gorilla glue #4 as a morning (small dose and uplifted, energetic) and nighttime (relaxed, sleepy, reduced tension) cannabis. Have fun experimenting.

ChronicComic,"Quick review: (NOTE: all my reviews are done with a onie and one bowl only taking 4 hits) Great strain,perfect for sleep, attacks the head and eyes. Indica strong. Still has a nice body tingle which would help you relax if you are like me and have restless leg syndrome that prevents you from relaxing long enough to slip to sleep.   Detailed review Smell: I'd say this smells very chemically with a sweet flowery smell like you would find with 'green crack'   Look: Very light dense buds with short orange/red hairs occasionally popping up. Coated incredibly nice with trichromes, it could only be described as looking really kiefy.   Taste: Like the smell, it has an initial chemical taste with an earthy wood after taste.   Feeling: It was a slow start that crept up on my eyes. It hit me in the forehead first and moved around to my entire head in probably a span of 5 minutes. Next your extremities start to tingle, like that feeling after you just shocked yourself. It has a slight energy to it that could make it useful if you were to be doing something (like writing an interview as I am now) but i would definitely use this to go to sleep. I would NOT use as a &quot;wake and bake&quot; or afternoon smoke, I would say this is the &quot;wait till after work and you just had a crappy day and need to relax on the couch and put on your favorite episode of Firefly&quot; kinda strain that really helps you relax when your on edge. Good strain for ADHD, Insomnia, muscle pain and anxiety. Probably not a good strain for depression, exercising or operating any kind of machinery that isn't an xbox controller. All in all this is an amazing strain 9/10 that I would want to have around for those crappy days and sleepless nights.  I purchased this strain from High Country Healing off of Academy in Colorado Springs. This strain was recomended to me from the manager who was incredibly helpful and has been time and time again.

Hard to pull the smells apart but very pungent. Some pine and earth but just overpowered by the Sour. I really hope it carries over to the smoke.  Look: Tight dense nugs. Very light green with bright orange hairs with a fine trim. Kif visibly fell from the scissor cuts.  Taste: Delightfully potent, a bit earthy and Chem Dawg is definitely nearby chanting, â€œMe or the Sour!?â€ù It is not an immediate favorite like some diesel flavors I have found but this #4 was not the most pungent out of all I have sampled by far, just since I started reviewing strains.

Dry mouth was pretty strong here, but it was definitely worth it. The relaxing effect is incredibly helpful at the end of a long day. Best way to relax. Go home, cook yourself an amazing dinner. Before you eat it, have a little GG4. Then sit down to your meal in front of the TV and watch some stand up comedy.

This hybrid combines the best of both and does not have alot of downside at all.  I will say it is not for the novice or beginner - it can cause feelings of paranoia if you are a light user.  Gorilla Glue #4's best quality is the balance - you will not be overly disoriented as is common with some sativas (unless you take too much!), and you will not melt into the couch as is commonly believed ( unless you a new user).   Start slow, wait 15 minutes, and then take a second dose if you are not getting the desired results of this strain.",4,original-glue

tmaass4,"Truly stand alone bud, I have found no competitors. Now I've only been a daily, educated smoker for going on 5 months now and I wouldn't call myself a connoisseur, but I've done my fair share of strain exploration in this short time. After taking two hits from our bong, my fiancÃ© and I were immediately all smiles and giggles. I was smiling obliviously at my laptop while I did mundane wedding planning tasks. The happiness and light heartedness you feel are amazing!! Everything feels so simple and doable. After a little bit, the indica really starts to kick in and the &quot;glue&quot; part of the strain kicks in. I think I may have moved once from the couch in the hours we were there. Your thoughts and emotions feel light as a feather but your limbs and eyes start to get a little heavy. While I can say it didn't necessarily make me sleepy, once I laid down, it didn't take long for tiredness to hit. It leaves you in a deep, sedated relaxation.

Got really lucky and the local new and best dispensary , the third day, was out of the $10 strain I wanted, so the budtender was kind enough to give me a deal on some $15 gorilla glue and give it to me for 10/g. Super stinky! This is not a discreet weed, just having a little nug sitting out stinks up the whole room. Not my favorite flavor with its powerful diesel-chemical-piney like taste. Feels really good though, so it's worth the taste. Stoney behind the eyes, a bit floaty and happy too just after one big bong rip. Honestly makes a good smoke any time of day.

Fernand,"Nice dark flavorful Gorilla Glue Oil. I'm dabbing some on a sore inside a nostril, so the whole world smells sweet &amp; dank. This is a subtle Gorilla. Maybe it's Gorilla Glue #6 ;-). It's serious medicine, I don't think it's for the get-fucked-up crowd :  because the effect is so specific. I don't really notice the (78%) THC so much. It's rather masked or antagonized by other components. So there's no squirrel cage shutter-flutter, no anxieties, no confusion, and some might say &quot;no high&quot;. For social anxiety, it would be a good choice. It's balanced, more on the Indica side -- that unquestionably comes through with a good body melt, and I can believe the reports of couch lock w/ large amounts. Thing is, I wouldn't dream of wasting it that way.  In small amounts it's a blessing for those living with pain. I know pain, and I know remedies. This is the most atypical cannabis I've ever sampled, because it almost feels like puffs of ope, but with a somehow smarter, more benign analgesia than w/ Rx analgesics. Not a simple thing. But it works calm and measured, positive mood, not fake-euphoric, and with significant pain relief, not limited to the lower spine/legs/back. Pretty long lasting. After a while I notice a subtle secondary boost, sensory, and very mild &quot;psychedelic&quot; effects come in. Not a sleepy effect, yet good to fall asleep on. I haven't fully figured it out; it's intriguing.   On the negatives, well, De Quincy would say who cares, but it's clearly not a party strain. I'd add that it's not as clear-headed as e.g. my favorite Diesels. It lasts, but as it decays I get a smidge fuzzy and sleepy, with a touch of headache, eyes a bit redder than I'd have guessed (so it's relaxing blood vessels).   Focus? With the Gorilla, I can focus on tasks, get a little side-tracked, not feeling lightning bright, but keep going. The unusual pain relief allows all sorts of miraculous tricks, like walking around without wincing, and fully enjoying exploring the planet. A good one to keep in a vape pen for as-needed relief.",4,original-glue

quentello,"Strain: Gorilla Glue #4 Seller: House of Gas - Anaheim, Ca Consumed: Vaporized (S&amp;B Crafty), multiple sessions, multiple times of the day. Temperature: 188C   Gorilla Glue #4 hit hard as expected with its original flavor and showed potential to be an aesthetically marvelous bud.   The bud is radiant and particularly lively. The leaves appear healthy and voluminous. Scarce orange pistils, consistent trichomes, and overall lighter-green shaded flowers. The sight was a nice impression however the accompanying smell had more to be desired.   Though remarkable in many aspects, I found my tasting of this hybrid strain to fall short in its flavor. The initial draw is dense, leaving way into an overwhelming pine flavor with a chemical-flavored tail-end. The pine creates an imbalance of flavors and masks the other scents present within the flower. To have better flavor, the strain's palette of aromas needs to be able to leave more &quot;breathing&quot; room to mature and tame the flower's broad spectrum of tastes. The chemical flavor needs to have some sort of support or complement flavor as well.   The general flavor mellows out after several draws, leaving behind a subtle sourness in the background. Gorilla Glue's original flavor remains within consumers palette for quite some time.   The genetics of the strain are well balanced, making for a manageable hybrid that has noticeable sativa and indica effects. The high is well and manageable. This strain has more potential than it presently shows and I believe it holds higher value as a good strain that has the potential to be cross-bred in order to breed great strains.

plschoosenewusername,"Gorilla Glue #4 lives up to the hype   GG#4 is some fire! Just picked up a zip of this stuff. It smells more pungent than OG, and gets you higher than Girl Scout Cookies. The buds are large, dense, chunky, and so trichome covered the buds appear almost white. This stuff has tested over 34% THC.  Although GG#4 is a sativa dominant hybrid, its effects are indica dominant especially in high quantities. The strong, long lasting high is good for this with a high tolerance. The effects are initially very euphoric and uplifting, and later sedative and stoney. The sativa qualities fade after a couple of hours and the couch lock effects become much more strongly pronounced. This strain does leave you somewhat &quot;groggy&quot; for a while even after the high leaves. GG#4 is a perfect afternoon to bedtime strain due to the high chances of you being blissfully couch locked. Expect an intense case of munchies. I would not recommend GG#4 for new smokers due to its initial intense head buzz and for being paranoia inducing. This strain is ideal for pain, depression, insomnia, and lack of appetite.

SalmonCreekBigBuds,"I don't give out 5 stars lightly, but this strain has earned a permanent place in my collection.  My favorite dispensary in San Francisco keeps it stocked, and it's always been from the same grower using the same cut.  Consistency has been the same from other locations as well; sometimes a variation in bud structure or coloration, but always the same distinct taste and effect.  Sweet citrus / diesel smell that tastes like grapefruit in the vape, and hints of pine and diesel when smoked.  Vaping is the way to go if you desire the clear-headed sativa effects and full taste profile.  GG Strains has made this one a winner for people who like to enjoy long lasting, clear-headed sativa effects.

Well if you know me you know there is research behind my EVERY claim! lol READ ON! :)  Leafly is the #1 website for reviews. I started by looking at all strains with over 1,000 reviews... there were 30 or so. Next I completely IGNORED the final review score... wait, what? That number is simply the average of all the star ratings (0-6), I wanted something more useful. PS, You should see me look for an amazon product, it takes me hours before I click the buy button! lol  I was interested in the NEGATIVE numbers, so after gathering all the data for each strain by capturing the HTML source code from each review page (that's called 'scrubbing'), the final number was the percent of reviews with a zero or one.  I want to have the LEAST chance of a bad experience... purrrrfect number!  GG4 was the overwhelming winner, with 1 percent of users rating it 0 or 1. The other 29 or so ranged from 2 to 30!  The top 5 were: GG4 = 1% negative reviews Gelato = 2% Platinum GSC = 4% Death Star = 5% Tahie OG Kush = 5%  So why stop there? &lt;oh nooooo&gt; hehe  I did the same on three other, less popular websites, then averaged the three final scores together with Leafly weighted 50% more than the other two (after throwing out ANY that had a 10% or higher negative score).

vanillachigchampa,"I can't say much about the recreational side of Original Glue, but I feel it is important to mention that Original Glue (or what I assume is Original Glue named &quot;Gorilla Glue&quot;) has helped me immensely while experiencing intense waves of depression.

Even while feeling suicidal, having this at hand kept me going &amp; moved me into a more positive head-space. To be honest, that head-space didn't feel like something that'd come out of a &quot;high&quot;. It did what I assume my antidepressants should normally be doing.

If you are like me, and take your cannabis consumption serious, picky on your strains, and prefer something stronger but not engulfing you in a heavy (clothes drenching) scent, GG4 is perfect. It helps me with my insomnia, body aches, and allows me to continue my day of work without excessive groggy feelings, etc. Do know it is NOT for light smokers. I often forget I am more adjusted to stronger strains that my friends and their first usage of GG4 is always a good laugh. Its become a staple to all of them as well, and a chosen guarantee of a great default strain. Usually averages high levels of THC content. 20%+ usually around the 25%.  Ive used GG4 for years, Flower, concentrate, etc. never a bad batch.",5,original-glue

Almost instantaneous high from first draw, but it intensified after 5 minutes. Almost instant pain relief &amp; total relaxation &amp; a clear head without couch lock.

I didnâ€™t have a care in the world and everything was better.  My creative senses were tingling, I could hear colors and see sounds. Touch felt amazing and sex was incredible.

CannabisExpert,"I know why they call it Original Glue. Because it's all gooey, and the reason it's all gooey is because of the ultra high content in THC. Buds are really sticky and you know that it's good bud when it sticks to your fingers. Long lasting high. One or two hits will take you a long ways. And you are talking to a cannabis expert here. I have been smoking every day in a bong for the past 32 years. The only reason I'm giving it four out of five stars is because of the aesthetics of the bud, it doesn't look that good but when you feel it you know that it's an ultra high quality bud. High energy, good mood, munchies under control.  I would come back for more. Another one on my list of good bud.",4,original-glue

PURPpplEATER,"Just vaped this for the first time. Holy crap is this stuff good so far.  I've been a heavy smoker for a while now and stick to vaping mostly for convenience sake as well as taste. After a few drags, the effects of GG4 kicked in pretty hard.   My body feels very relaxed right now but I don't feel tired. Almost like your body is taking a nap without the actual sleep. I feel a little spacy right now, but my eyelids don't feel heavy. This strain definitely makes you drift off.  I don't think this would be the best in public. I don't feel glued to the couch but I don't really want to leave the house to do anything. Definitely one to enjoy if you don't have anything to do.  The only slight downside is the taste. It's got a pretty good flavor but it's just not my favorite. (I've been spoiled vaping Blue Cookies recently..which tastes fantastic)",5,original-glue
sirhchris,"GG4  is fire!  First on is aroma:  It has a very distict smell. Sweet, Chemical like, something of Race Gas...less the fumes.  I would love to be at the dispensary just smelling away at these.  The smell is so addicting.  Flavor:  Earthy, Pine, small hint of citrus.  I used a PAX3 vape on level 3.  My first initial reaction was this made me feel super heavy in the shoulders.  I was so relaxed that I started to slump off the couch and onto the floor.  I didn't know what to expect, it made me so couch locked, more like floor locked, that I didn't know what to do other than just stay there and keep listening to The Defenders on Netflix.  I had a hard time keeping my eyes open but I was completely awake.  Here's the weird part, there was some taste was linking in my mouth, something sweet, I cant explain what it is, I don't care.  I liked it.  now every time I smoke it, I taste this unexplainable flavor that's stuck in my mouth. Now that I have a little more tolerance, I can do things around the house.  I suffer from chronic joint pain caused by a lot sports injuries, I usually run a CBD based topical on my aching joints with GG4 post training and it helps.  For me, the buzziness that came with the high lasted about an hour, 1.5 at most but I was still rather relaxed.  I usuallu This is definitely a night time strain, and I highly recommend GG4",5,original-glue

hughlaurie,"This is a really interesting strain: a LOT of classic-stoner effects, but it pushes all the stoner effects too far, too fast, so none of them are really desirable.  Another user called this a sugar rush strain. I 100% agree. It temporarily speeds you up, and then you CRASH into couch-lock. No good. Do you ACTUALLY like sugar-rushes? Me neither.  Mark my words: you simply cannot get any work done on this strain, as you become EXTREMELY FORGETFUL extremely quickly. And it lasts quite a long time, 5+ hours. So that's a HUGE downside. You are literally SO FORGETFUL, you have written off work for the day.  Then why did I give this a 2-3 star? Because it's still stoning. These are CLASSIC stoner effects, gone too far. But the fact is: YOU GET STONED. The problem is - in order to reach a desired level of EUPHORIA, you have to take more of it, and the BODY STONING EFFECTS at that level are TOO HIGH.   So either you don't have euphoria, and have the perfect level of body-stoning, OR you go for the Euphoria and over-shoot the body-stoning, and there are terrible consequences to that. So it's not a well-balanced strain; the body stoning effects are out of whack with the euphoria.  Negative effects are there.  For example:   GENERALISED WEAKENING OF MUSCULATURE: Any muscle feels like it has LESS ENERGY. A lot of the effects below are actually a direct consequence of this.  MASSIVELY DRY EYES. Sounds fun, but soon blinking actually hurts, feels like slight sandpaper, or at least directly causes extreme discomfort.   LOW EYES, sounds fun, but it makes it difficult to see stuff, because you have to spend MASSIVE energy just to open your eyes. How is that fun?  MASSIVE FORGETFULNESS. Sounds fun, until you can't even remember what you were enjoying. This is probably the single biggest flaw of GG#4.  MASSIVELY DRY THROAT, sounds fun, until breathing gets irritating.  I had a PANIC ATTACK on this, accidentally took too much. The entire right side of my chest felt constricted.   The other effects that happened when I got this high were:  FURTHER DECREASED PHYSICAL ENERGY IN MUSCLES. I felt like simply flexing any muscles like biceps or moving fingers in fine movement was TOO MUCH WORK.  CONSTRICTED BLOOD VESSELS in upper body. All my blood vessels felt like my heart had difficulty pumping through them.  DIFFICULTY BREATHING. During my panic attack, in keeping with WEAKENED MUSCLES I had difficulty simply breathing, and my breathing got REALLY SHALLOW. Like almost no chest movement. I feel like I could have died, except my friends were around to massage me to decrease my discomforts.",2,original-glue

Psychlon,"Alone, itâ€™s a very hybrid experience, with intense relaxation and moderate euphoria in relative balance. While the euphoria falls short of a strong sativaâ€™s, I have found that there is a particular quality to the GG4 mental effects: curiosity enhancement. This strain seems to boost my interest level, without making me feel overly invested (in a euphoric or dysphoric way) in whatever is holding my attention. This quality of â€œneutral awareness enhancerâ€ù plus its relaxation effects have made it my go to as a ground note for blending with other chemovars, to get the desired effect.

I wish the effects lasted longer (Mostly head high, helped with nausea, appetite, headache, and my mood turned to happy and relaxed quickly!) It doesnâ€™t quite give me couch lock, but it does sedate me... my wife is usually very sensitive to cannabis and gets high off of next to nothing, 1-2 small hits and she was feeling hungry, laughing, and more talkative as well.

PineappleScott,"GG4 , Gorilla Glue, Original Glue  This is a legendary strain. It also had legendary shoes to fill.   The quality of the flower I got was ok. I got it for 1.60 a gram during 4:20 so I wasn't expecting any miracles. This flower was 20 percent THC and i've seen it as high as 30. So this was probably middle of the road stuff.   It smelled very sour. One of the most sour of any recent experience. It was a dense and hard bud. Sugar and orange hairs abound.   I took my first light. This log sent dense milky clouds into the pipe immediately. Very fast burning, despite it's density.   The throat hit was immediate and in the words of Nelson from the simpsons - &quot; It tastes like burning &quot; . A very pungent woody and intense burn ... with a sort of grape after taste when it was all over.   The high did live up to its reputation. It was intense and immediate. Right up there with GSC for knock you on your ass level of stoned. I was out of it after the first rip and the second one just sent me even more overboard.   Very psychedelic, dry mouth, eyes, throat. I was pretty much good for nothing. Not sure how i'm going to complete the rest of my night actually.   For me this high was sort of too intense. My paranoia was rampant and it was like a haunted house that I just wanted to escape. I didn't like the place it took me. I was frightened to go downstairs and try and face my family.   Medicinally ... you would have to be in a very dark place for this to do anything for you ... and if you are not careful I could see this pushing some people over the edge. I would only use it as essentially a pair of shock paddles. What I mean is .... They could save you if you're dead ... But kill you if you are already alive.   Very Very Freakin intense and strange ... and for this reason its 3 stars. A 2 on the enjoyment scale. But a 5 in that I will never forget this one.

My first time trying it I didnt care for it like I do others, it tasted like I licked a home improvement store and really didnâ€™t leave the greatest after taste. Didnt think i would care for it.  Now my 5th time was a much better experience. Each time i try it it grows on me and becomes more rewarding. First hit tasted like beach, ocean front, salty type of outdoor taste but in a good way. It is a pretty heavy hitter but in a timely way, its not a sudden high but a smooth, slow setting high that i feel deep in my chest and upper legs more then anything. Lower legs feel relaxed and feet tingle a little bit.   Im watching Night at the Roxbury for the first time while on this and it doesnt really seem to give me laughing fits that make me crack up. A very relaxing high that has been enjoyable the last few times and doesnt give me dry mouth or dry eyes. I do feel a little anxious but not in a bad way. Doesnt really make me have the munchies but i will say this particular strain makes my stomach feel so calm and normal. Usually i battle lots of gurgling sounds in my stomach and always feels a little upset but not with this strain and lasts the whole next day. My stomach problems dont bother me so even though this is nice its not why i keep trying it.  If i had the choice i probably would pick a couple other strains over it because taste wasnt that great compared to others and although i enjoy what this does for me theres others out there that give me a more pleasant uplifting high, this one feels like a high with little personality if that makes sense.",4,original-glue
MagicLady,"It's not called OG for nothing.  GG4 (Gorilla Glue/Original Glue OG Glue) is a hell of a strain! This sucker can put even the most seasoned of stoners down on their ass or perk them right up with an abundance of energy. It's a strong high, but not overwhelmingly so. The worst you might experience is you might fall asleep, or time slows down greatly to you.  I recently purchased GG4 grown by From the Soil at Dank's Wonder Emporium in Lacey, WA and it was certainly worth a go. It's one of those strains you hear older stoners talking about from their youth so you know it's got a good running history. It's a drab sort of green and smells quite pungent, but it has great earthy tones a and strong hints of pine, just perfect for this PNW unicorn. It plants me right on my rump and makes my legs feel like jelly. It makes me kind of a spaz, when I'm not intensely engrossed in whatever I am doing, and gives me a very euphoric and happy trip. Psychedelic stoner rock is amazing to listen to when using GG4.  I would not recommend this to people looking for anxiety relief as I find that my anxiety will still be under the high and I tend to pace the floor, looking for things to clean or organize. Great for depression though. Perks you right up. Overall, I loved it a lot and I will certainly smoke it again and recommend it to anyone who loves a good ol' traditional high.

casual420,"GG4 caught me off-guard in a few ways. The buds are like nothing I've seen before; much more leafy than I expected, when I first received mine, I was worried I might have gotten some cheap shwag that would resemble parsley after grinding. I gave it a rough grind and vaped it. 15 minutes passed, and the effect was so mild, I was convinced I got a bag of ditch weed instead of the premium foliage I was expecting. That's when it started to shift gears. I felt it concentrate in my head in stages: 2nd gear, 5 minute plateau, shift to 3rd gear, 5 minute plateau, shift to 4th gear, 5 minute plateau and finally it shifted into high gear. At that moment (about an hour in), the high trickled down into my body. My head, neck, shoulders and chest got tingly in a nice, relaxed way. It never left my head, it just spread about a bit. After a couple hours, the high concentrated back in my head, and it dipped down to about 1/2 - 2/3 strength, where I enjoyed a nice glow for another hour or two. The effects were surprisingly long-lasting, and for the couple hours peak time, it was as good quality as any high-grade premium I've tried. The smell and taste are consistent and pleasant - piney and earthy, my batch is rather lemony as well. What I thought would be my least favorite strain (or possibly ditch) ended up being one of my favorite smokes yet. 5/5",5,original-glue

This stuff gave me more couchlock than any indica has gave me. Overall this is a really potent strain.",5,original-glue
monique79,"*I have for about 10 mins been trying to describe this. So baked.*  This seriously has me on different levels at different times. One minute I'm so relaxed, stuck, feeling like gumby. Next I realize how high I am and get a tad paranoid and anxious (definitely does NOT help my anxiety/panic attacks), dizzy, and weirded out. Then I'm happy, giddy, hungry, giggly, and aroused (Zoloft kills this for me). Not necessarily in that order.   Still trying to find the ones that suit my needs. This one is potent and for as long as I been smoking it... I still can't decide if I like it (I'm gonna go on a limb here and say I probably do _Ÿ˜‰).   My Cons: Dizziness, headache, and anxious/paranoid.  ",4,original-glue
MoTokez,"I felt the effects were more in line with a Sativa strain. This gave me quite the head rush, and I will admit that I experience some slight paranoia as an experienced smoker. Not a bad strain, I just don't think this would be a good idea to indulge in if you have a lot of anxiety as I could see this making it a little worse. Those that are sensitive to panic attacks may want to beware. Cheers!",3,original-glue

Yes this stuff is amazing, I've seriously never smoked anything like it.  It feels like the drummer is playing my skeleton with his drum sticks like a xylophone. Music has never sounded better.

tripdog,"It's got a heady rush that lasts 30-40 minutes or so and gives way to a classic Indica stone. You may be able to get a few things done before you find yourself happily reclining on the sofa.   Potency is very strong, and little goes a long way. The flavor is fantastic with a robust piney sourness that tastes almost exactly as it smells. It's a good smoke but an absolutely delicious vape.  These flowers are heavily crystalized, decorated by hints of red hairs throughout the somewhat dense conical bud. One of the best strains I've had. Love it.",5,original-glue

uncrunner93,"Gorilla Glue is definitely one of those iconic strains that I love for body pain, stress, and lazy mornings. Only giving 4 stars bc the dry mouth is always unreal for me lol also, your eyes will definitely get low and eye drops only do so much so just not the best strain to smoke and then go to work or a family get together without everyone else knowing youâ€™re stoned haha sometimes thatâ€™s just fine but personally, I just want to be Stoney bologna without everyone else knowing I am haha",4,original-glue

Coated my glass with black resin after just one bowl.  This hits you with a real thick daydreamy cetebral high. Just when you think its done with you, the Indica fairy arrives. Go ahead and forget about the rest of the day, its time to veg on YouTube and snacks. Delivered some nice anxiety / stress relief and helped me crush a bunch of snarky ass teens in CoD.  Not for noobs, and definitely not a high energy party strain.",4,original-glue
Cryrste,"This is one of my favorite bedtime strains. Iâ€™ve tried this strain from a couple of different growers &amp; dispensaries. Sometimes it has purple tones &amp; a grape flavor, other times it doesnâ€™t. Depends on the phenotype &amp; genotype... plus some growers just have their grow nailed down perfectly &amp; many others are still working on improvements. Thatâ€™s just how it is. But this strain is very relaxing &amp; will knock you out after a bowl. I relax, my aches &amp; pains ease, my stress &amp; anxiety melt away, &amp; I just want to close my heavy eyelids &amp; fall into a blissful sleep. ",4,original-glue

KotaChrome11,What the other reviews have said is 100% accurate! This strain definitely gives you a little boost of energy but then that turns into being glued to the couch. Itâ€™s not good for concentration but it does make you think a lot. Itâ€™s also a great mood booster! If youâ€™re having an anxiety attack this strain will calmly sit you on your ass. ,5,original-glue
crubio,The most sedative strain I've smoked,5,original-glue
Augie_Doggie,This strain is fantastic !  No matter where or what the ailment Gg4 bring relief... respite from pain and nausea.  It brings down inflammation and allows you to be still without distraction from injuries and pain.  Nice sleeper too... half a joint in and I was out,5,original-glue
843blower,Taste is earthy with a tone citrus. Excellent body and head high. Iâ€™ve tried in both concentrate and flower and definitely a legend,5,original-glue
GardeningAtNight,"I noticed this strain has gained immense popularity in recent years, mainly due to its very high THC content and level of trichomes. I finally picked some up a few weeks back (long overdue) and this was my experience.  Aroma/Appearance- This stuff smells extremely pungent. Itâ€™s like the stereotypical weed smell but even stronger. Itâ€™s clear to me at this point that this is going to be some dank stuff. By barely touching the buds, my fingers were already sticky. The buds have so many trichomes on them, that it almost looks lightly dusted with snow.  Taste- GG tastes very similar to the smell. Piney, Pungent, and even skunky. Itâ€™s the type of taste that true weed lovers would appreciate immensely.   Effects- Extremely sedating and couch locking. Tingly and Euphoric. In my experience, not energetic and uplifting at all despite dominant sativa origins. I could barely hold a conversation on this stuff.. It made me completely stoned, not high.   Iâ€™ve been smoking weed for a long time, and GG4 is one of the most potent strains Iâ€™ve ever had. I would not recommend this to beginners, as it knocked an experienced vet (me) on my ass. I was completely floored and caught off guard. Regardless, this strain feels amazing to be on. Itâ€™s euphoric and numbing as hell, and I will definitely buy again.  ",5,original-glue
Emhxo8212,"Bought this from a dispensary in Boston the other day. First time smoking it had me very talkative and euphoric for the first 15 minutes, then I suddenly melted into the couch and took a three hour nap. I literally felt like a log. I donâ€™t really like strains that make me sleepy but this is really good and REALLY strong. ",4,original-glue
Joelxb,I underestimated the power of GG #4 got some thinking it was gonna be a light high boy was I wrong... this strain knocked me on my ass i was couch locked and could barely move this feeling came and went overall it was nice and relaxing amazing strain 10/10 would recommend but start with small hits then move up!,5,original-glue

ghostlady,"very potent strain, leaves me feeling really euphoric and a few hits will get me pretty high. an absolute favorite, usually i prefer indica dominant hybrids but GG4 feels like a perfect balance to me. smells great, tastes great, it truly lives up to its reputation. definitely not the strain for anything active though, it usually has me not wanting to move lmao",5,original-glue

UrTwoDadz,"Iâ€™ve been smoking for about 5 years now and Iâ€™d have to say this is my favourite strain. It hits you hard with a cerebral head buzz then mellows you out to a nice indica body high. High thc, depending on the grade quality it ranges from 22-32%. Its one of the most potent flowers you can get. Highly recommend for people who feel the need to self medicate or just want a great high. 5/5 no doubt. Love GG4 ",5,original-glue

ChronicFlutist,"Sorry, guys. Not with it. This helps with pain, but it is only daytime appropriate and it gives me anxiety instead of taking it away. Definitely not for me and not for others like me. To be fair, I almost exclusively smoke indica-Dominant hybrids. This may just have too much sativa for me or it just isn't my thing.   First strain I've bought I didn't really like. In fact, I very much disliked it. Would not recommend to a regular indica user.   Would be good for a diet, I think. Kills your appetite. Overall, just not what I'm looking for. If they made a more indica dominant version, I think I would like it, because it is exceptional for pain.",2,original-glue

I would always see it on various dispensary menus (as it's a popular strain), but for some reason I never had the urge to try it out; maybe because the name &quot;GG4&quot; just sounds like an inherently sativa strain to me.  Needless to say, I finally gave the GG4 a shot and I LOVE IT, MAN! To me, this is your perfect basic, balanced hybrid strain that you should always have on deck. The scent and taste are pretty mild, but very nice and not offensive or &quot;too much&quot; in any way. Probably my #1 go-to balanced hybrid strain now :)",5,original-glue

This strain will have you glued to to couch, stoned out of your mind. Great for relaxation, de stressing, pain, insomnia or just chilling out and watching tv or playing video games. The high seems to hit me pretty fast( as in 1-2 minutes after my first bong rip) it starts coming on pretty hard. Then boom 15-20 min later Im laid out on the couch. I wouldn't recommend for beginners. The high for me is a smaller head high, good body stone/ body feels warm and completely relaxed.",5,original-glue

I'm not really a huge &quot;couch&quot; high fan but this one stole my heart. I like how euphoric I feel when I smoke it. It's the kind of high that makes you want to look at pretty landscape pictures all day and rock back &amp; forth to music. Food tastes really good too. My favorite part about it is the smell...I've always loved that earthy cannabis aroma, and whenever I walk into my apartment I'm greeted with the happy memories, lol.  The only thing I don't like about Glue is the same thing I constantly bash indica dominant hybrids for: I feel too tired to function. My eyes feel like they're dried out, along with my mouth, and I want to sleep instead of doing what I'm supposed to do. I would say smoke this at night or on the weekend. Overall though, I'm satisfied.",4,original-glue

medicalguy62,"Just loaded a few pinches of Gorilla Glue in my bowl. The buds, bright green and coated in resin, had a sweet and earthy aroma and were hard to grind up. Only a few hits in and it has me soaring. Initially the mind high comes on quick and is uplifted and focus. I took my time on this bowl, and it was towards the end, the last few hits, when the &quot;stoned&quot; feeling first creeped on behind my eyes. The strong body high comes on slow at first but in full swing is very effective for pain management. This selection of GG4 is potent so it only took a small amount to feel this spectrum of effects. Despite the strong body high and increasingly hazy mental state, GG4 has a certainly sativa kick to it, a motivating effect, that keeps it from being a total couch lock strain.",4,original-glue

JDreamer,"A total classic. Always reliable for those times when you really just need to get properly stoned.   For heavy smokers (youâ€™ve probably already tried this strain!), youâ€™ll be able to easily navigate the hybrid nature of this high. If you wanna sleep, you definitely can. If you wanna stay up and relax and focus on a movie or show, you definitely can.   Only thing I would say is that this is a truly powerful strain. It will be difficult to focus on anything productive if you get really high on this strain. Itâ€™s just that heavy. Definitely not a bad thing though. You just gotta plan for it a bit.   Phenomenal earthy flavor, but I wouldnâ€™t say itâ€™s my favorite strain for pure flavor.. I really come to this strain for its powerful effects. Itâ€™s called Gorilla Glue for a reason (you get glued to the couch! _Ÿ˜‚) this strain is a must-have. This is a strain you have to try before you die.",5,original-glue

TheHighMathematician,"I vaped some of this at around 10 pm or so. It took some time to kick in. When it did, I felt a feeling of euphoria. However, that feeling was shortly replaced by a couch lock (or a bed lock in my case). My mind sort of went fuzzy and I couldn't type properly. This was a very unique high. I put on my headphones and decided to watch Avengers: Endgame. As I started the movie, I heard what I thought was my blender running. However, it was just some background noise in the movie. I decided to take my headphones off and watch it with the built-in speakers. I felt quite cold (despite it was summer and I had no AC in my room), so I put a blanket over me. This caused me to feel both hot and cold (if that's even possible). Shortly, I couldn't feel my body at all and quite suddenly, a mild paranoia hit. This didn't last very long, though, and there was no anxiety with it. I also found this high quite isolating (unlike Alaskan Thunder Fuck and Blissful Wizard). I felt like I was in a cocoon drifting in some higher-dimensional space. I got up to get some water but felt gravity multiply. It wasn't unpleasant, though; just went to show the strong effects of the strain on the body. Overall a great experience which was very relaxing and body-focused. Definitely not for beginners, though. The only reason I have given it a 4/5 instead of the full 5/5 is that this high didn't last very long (about an hour or so). Otherwise, a great strain which I'd be willing to try again soon.",4,original-glue

Heshianpriest,"This is a very fabled strain for me that I sought after for a long time. About a year ago on a work trip my coworker offered to smoke me out after a long day of work. As he is packing the bowl I smelled the strong and pungent odor and instantly new it was dank. I asked what strain and he responded â€œOG Glue aka GG4 aka Larry Birdâ€ù. First bong hit in and I am super lifted. The stress and sore muscles of the long day evaporated. We smoked all of his glue that day!   Months and months pass and I dream of the high from that day. It hit like when I first started blazing years and years ago. To my surprise that friend texts me saying he has come across the legendary Glue again! I picked up close to an ounce!  This is a super potent indica with dense, soft, hazy white, and crumbly buds. This strain is both a super potent medicinally as well as recreationally relaxing strain. Most strains donâ€™t make me giddy or excited these days and this one does. I would ad if used sparingly it works well for anxiety/depression. Personally I want to get the full effect so this is perfect after a long day of work or a stoned out weekend!  If you stumble upon this strain during your quests, donâ€™t hesitate to pick it up in large quantities! You wonâ€™t be disappointed and I guarantee it will exceed your expectations!",5,original-glue

GG4 definitely left me glued to my bed and  my eyes glued to phone. although, it made me and even my other friends who tried it schiz out. but after using the cart for a couple days i stopped schizzing. another thing that stood out was my extreme dry mouth and eyes. i would catch myself blinking a lot to keep my contacts from drying out and falling out. again, GG4 in a cart may vary from the actually flower, but i did not enjoy this strain very much, at least from a cart.

I've found that GG#4 is great at eliminating my pain. After a few hits, I can't even feel my toes. This strain also makes me more energetic and social. Near the end of the high I get incredibly sleepy.  I use the DaVinci IQ vaporizer with this strain, so my effects are likely different than smoking it.

When I stuck my nose in the container and took a strong whiff, I was taken aback.  The onset of effect for me smoking flower through a mini water pipe, was maybe 15-20 seconds. The effects increase steadily and almost immediately I feel a calm, relaxing wave. Like making a big out breath.   It's very relaxing, euphoric, generally calming. Minimal paranoia.

Dr.Coinpurse,"Do not have anything planned to do that involves physically moving your body from point A to point B. This is coming from a runner who typically gets up and post breakfast, I digest and smoke some weed. Once that happens a walk/ light run combo takes place and I love being outside. I went into trying this bud thinking I could fight the â€œcouch lockâ€ù associated with it and I got stoned to a rude awakening. So comfortable and the best part is, usually when Iâ€™m totally still when high I get alittle anxious. Thereâ€™s none of that. I also meditate and am hyper aware of how  thoughts come, go, how you get stuck in thought loops without  consciously realizing it, and how fast they seems to travel in a sober state of mind. This affects absolutely none of that. Thatâ€™s are same speed and actually super clear. Perfect for something along the lines of fortnite if you are a really competitive player and donâ€™t like to lose lol. Youâ€™ll be good for sure! (I mainly just watch myself but for some reason, I thought of that example). Donâ€™t seems to be any sort of hungry or energetic but just very mellow and relaxed is really the big one.

LotusKai,"This is one of my favorite Indica's (even though this strain is a 50/50 hybrid.) While this strain definitely has a nice Sativa buzz to it, the Indica body stone is where it's at when it comes to this one. After smoking some one can expect to be routed to wherever they're sitting and most likely fall asleep (if they've smoked enough) otherwise except lethargy and the munchies. This strain is great for unwinding at night and playing some video games or watching a movie but not one I would choose if I had to go to work or be very productive. Being a Colorado native I'm lucky enough to get this strain quite often and I've personally never been disappointed in any cut I've had of it, even shake of it has been fire.

I'd feel weird stuff in my head, the pressure against my pillow even would be too much, etc. Now it was manageable anxiety/paranoia, but sorta stood on that line between &quot;manageable enough to smoke it the next night&quot; and &quot;I don't really want to smoke this anymore.&quot;",3,original-glue

GreenPie,"Definitely leans more on the Indica side for me, especially body-wise, which I like. When I was in the hospital recovering from surgery I had some canna peanut butter with White Widow and it helped with the pain way better than the pain meds they were giving me. There are better strains for pain though, like Blueberry. It also had me really relaxed and chill. I would have otherwise been a little stressed out about being in a hospital and rather bored. Even though I was on a pretty high dose I could keep a straight face and act totally normal. Made me feel cool rather than anxious. Actually this strain gave me ZERO anxiety and I tend to get anxious so that is nice. When I find this in concentrate form I'll buy it again!",5,white-widow

GanjaGoddess410,"Genetics: â€œThe White Widow strain was first released to the public by Shantibaba, shortly after he founded the Green House Seed Company in 1994 with a Dutch partner named Arjan. The pedigree of this famous sativa/indica hybrid is made up of a pure Brazilian sativa mother and a South Indian, Keralan hybrid father. The exact origins of the mother plant remains somewhat of a mystery but the most educated guess is that it could possibly be the old school, Brazilian landrace Manga Rosa, which has a long history of spiritual use. The Father was discovered during a trip to India where Shantibaba was approached by a man, who after sharing a joint with him, eventually led him to his farm in the mountains of Kerala. The farmer then introduced him to an indica hybrid that had been selectively cultivated and bred towards optimum resin production in his village for a very long time. After several days of sampling the farmerâ€™s plants, Shantibaba left for the Netherlands with a batch of fresh seeds, from which he was soon to discover the male for his White Widow cross. He eventually bred it to the Brazilian Sativa mother, forming the spectacular White Widow.â€ù    http://www.seedsman.com/en/origins-of-white-widow/      Smell: Buttery is a good word to describe the taste of this strain. It also smells a bit sweet, and has a strong piney, earthy-ish smell as well.  You could compare the smell to a very sweet and creamy butter, with a strong background scent of pine.  The smell is ridiculously unique. I guarantee that you will never smell another strain like it. So, take a big whiff before itâ€™s gone!           Taste: It has a very rich and delicious taste that practically melts in your mouth, but the taste of pine is strong as well. It could not be mistaken for any other strain.  The taste is almost identical to the smell, but maybe a bit more earthy and piney than buttery. To get the full effect of how tasty White Widow can be, try putting a small piece of a nug on your tongue, and let it sit there for 30 seconds or so. I had chocolate ice cream with this strain in it, and when I tasted it, chocolate was the second flavor I tasted.  Usually chocolate overpowers most other flavors, but not White Widow.       Effects: (Keep in mind that my tolerance is ridiculously high, therefore the effects I feel may be less than what a person with a normal tolerance would feel from this strain.) Itâ€™s the best of both worlds. Itâ€™s 60% Sativa, which gives you a head-high, and 40% Indica, which gives you a body-high. In my experience with this strain, I felt as if it were more like 50/50 and not 40/60. You could definitely feel the silly, happy, high feeling that Sativa strains give you, but you also feel calm, relaxed, and even pretty sleepy from the Indica part of it.  Personally, it made me feel a bit more tired than I would have liked, but it didnâ€™t put me to sleep completely. I got some very nice visuals from this strain.         What Medical Conditions it Helps With: Anxiety- I smoke this strain when I feel a panic attack coming on.  After a couple hits it slowly calms you down to a point where the anxiety or panicky feelings are completely gone. Depression- I think many strains help with depression, but usually Sativa dominant strains help with depression but not anxiety. Itâ€™ll make you very silly, and youâ€™ll laugh at everything, no matter how sad you are before smoking. Physical Pain- In my opinion, this is a wonderful strain for any type of physical pain, including chronic pain. Especially because most strains that help with chronic pain will give you couch-lock..which sucks if you want to be pain-free but also able to do things. Insomnia- This strain will help with mild insomnia. If you have it bad, I suggest a more indica dominant strain. Creativity- Not a medical condition, but it does make you very creative!          Similar Strains: Ice. Ice is a 50/50 strain that is similar to White Widow in effects.  I enjoyed both of them very much. White Widow is a bit better quality, but Ice is great as well.      What the Buds Look Like: The nugs look like little pinecones, and are small in size. They are covered in a nice layer of trichomes and resin, which is mostly white and light green. The hairs on the bud are a light shade of amber.  The leaves tangle around the nugs, making them look even more aesthetically pleasing. The buds are frosty and coated in trichomes if you break them open and look inside. It is some very good looking bud, in my opinion.      I would suggest smoking it in: A bong or a bubbler. You can only really do this strain justice if you smoke it in glass piece. It has a very interesting taste. If you roll it in a joint or a blunt, you wonâ€™t be able to taste it as well.  I personally liked it rolled into joints as well, but my friends and I came to a consensus that it is much better in a pieceâ€_preferably a water piece. A bowl or vaporizer would be good as well. On a side note, it is a wonderful strain to put in edibles. My friend made a batch of lemon pound cake with this in it, and it tasted great!      (This was a review I posted previously on Tumblr. Sorry it's so long!)",4,white-widow
kantheist,"White Widow is a memorable strain for me, and not just because it was the first one I smoked. Even after years of daily smoking and vaporising, this strain's indica side still floors me.  It's scent and flavour are quite plain and natural, a simple earthen taste with a touch of wood.  The first few seconds of a hit will have you calm and relaxed (if not coughing madly), followed by a heavy couchlock that will leave you reaching for your favourite drink and snacks if not your bed.  I have trouble recommending this strain for medical use, as its effects aren't gentle at all. It hits ridiculously hard, and its sativa side will leave your mind wandering more than desired. Smoke with caution, and avoid combining White Widow with busy situations.",5,white-widow

willir97,"If you're looking for that perfect hybrid balance, and are okay with being spaced out for quite awhile, you've found the perfect strain. This herb is a light and fluffy bud, green with whitish hues in color, and covered in delicious little trichomes. When smelling from the container, it has a woody and slightly herbal smell, but when it's smoked it gives a more earthy and woody flavor. This strain is perfect when you need a little creativity boost as well as a great strain for going on walks or hike because it greatly enhances colors and details of any setting around you. A word of warning: newbies take caution, if you aren't accustomed to some potent effects and strong feeling of spacing out, this strain may bring a little anxiety and paranoia, otherwise, if that's not an issue with you, have at it and have fun.

Pikarya,"One of the best Hybrid strains. The high could be described as poisonous. Very slow creeping process which that spreads throughout the body until you're in a complete euphoric state (almost narcotic at times depending on your tolerance and experience).    Short term memory loss can be extremely likely at high amounts of intake. I've seen people experience Amnesia-like symptoms before where for a few seconds they forgot who they, or the people around them were.    Absolutely amazing. One of the few strains that can literally change your life.",5,white-widow
TSmoove,"My 1st time trying this strain and it was a pure RUSH to the dome piece! I initially did not like it... However, an exclaiming WOW factor! It felt like Chuck Norris kicked me in the head, right in the area where my sinuses are located. I then felt this heaviness over my eyes. Kinda like a rollercoaster ride when it get to its climbing height and releases down that gut wrenching hill at such a fast pace. The pressure that hits ur head is how this felt. Sitting in the house not doing anything was making the experience an unpleasant one. Low and behold, I stepped out on my patio and it was like OMG! I heard nature like never before. Every sound was amplified! I watched birds and listened to them like never before. It started to drizzle very lightly, but I saw the small fragile rain drops. Man! What a great feeling after the headiness subsided! I even found serenity during a brief moment of meditation. Then, when I came back in the house, I became very energetic. Through on some jazz and off I went around the house. I was even able to focus better on some school work / studying! My piece of advice: Find a place to relax and allow ur mind to open up. Enjoy being out in nature or turn on some relaxing music. Allow ur mind to travel and just listen! After that heavy head feeling goes away, find something you'd like to do and get busy doing it. Ur levels of creativity will soar, as well as ur energy levels! Great Stuff! ",4,white-widow

xSarahcate,"I love this strain and would highly (no pun intended) recommend it to anyone looking for an uplifting, smile-inducing effect. It hits smooth and the bud is just beautiful.  The reason I did 4 instead of 5 stars is because this strain did increase my issues with OCD. I would not recommend this strain to someone with obsessive-compulsive tendencies if they are going to be doing something that tends to trigger them. For example, I can not vape this strain and then try to write because I spend so much time perfecting every letter and I might get 1/3 of what everyone else gets done on an assignment because of intense focus on going over my letters. This could easily just be a personal issue, but I thought it might be helpful to some people.  Great strain, nonetheless!!",4,white-widow

u420,"I've been smoking for a long time, first recreationally and then medicinally. There are a number of legendary strains that I've wanted to try. Matinuska Thunder Fuck, Pineapple Express, Maui Wowie, OG Kush, Granddaddy Purple and White Widow. Up until recently, I had tried all but White Widow. I tried a strain that was supposed White Widow but had almost none of the reported effects. Then I found some at Northwest Health Center LLC in PDX. This strain seems to be hard to find, considering it's reputation. The buds are light/dark mottled green with orange hairs. I wouldn't call it frosty by any means. I needed magnification to see the crystals. The buds are not sticky at all and are a little woody. The smell is of pine but not very strong. Considering what I've read about the frosty, sticky, stinky qualities of this strain, I don't believe I got the best sample. Grinding was easy with little remaining material in the grinder. Vaping at 380 produced a heavy vapor, but it didn't make me want to cough. Effects started off slowly with a little uplifted and spacey feeling. Thoughts are not difficult with this strain and good conversations are possible and even enhanced. I was happy and boarderline giggly. It completely cleared up my nausea for about three hours, which is a fantistic duration for me. This is a active strain and not a couch-lock one. It didn't affect my ability to go to sleep when I went to bed, however. I didn't experience any anxiety or paranoia. This strain has some nifty indica effects as well in that it significantly helped control my lower back pain and muscle spasms. This would be a good strain for almost anything, relieving pain, nausea, anxiety, depression, stress, etc. Since the strength was strong even in a lower quality sample, I imagine a high quality sample would knock my socks off. Even the sample I tried has brought this strain into my top five. A good quality sample  might make number one. I intend to continue searching for, and sampling this strain whenever possible. -si",5,white-widow
Lumo,"First off, this was my second time trying White Widow since the early 2000s.  Upon opening the container, you get hit with a potent, room-filling scent that is reminiscent of dried berries with a slight touch of diesel and flowers.  The vape on this strain is very smooth and flavorful with subtle hints of sweetness and flowers with decent vape clouds.  The high is a bit of a creeper (5-10 minutes for full effects) and lasted 2-3 hours for me.  It was a moderate head high with an accompanied body warmness.  I didn't experience any full effects of energy, sleepiness or couch lock.  It was pretty much down the middle on everything while just feeling plain old stoned.",4,white-widow

He gave me a smile and said &quot;Oh he's German, and over did some White Widow.&quot; I bought a few grams and tested MY limit. Needless to say an excellent buzz.",4,white-widow
BakinKush,"Best strain out there, I felt like I was melting into my couch when I first smoked this. If you smoke this in moderation, it can be perfect for hanging out with friends, at school or your work, and also at parties. I would recommend this strain to anyone with the same conditions I experience. This helps me greatly with all of my problems, 10/10.",5,white-widow
ArthritisPain,"Beautiful flower. Crystals like I have never seen before. Smelled up the entire house with her awesome aroma. Smoke was smooth, and very powerful. But... I have arthritis pain, not a good flower for that. A great flower for depression maybe, not good for pain relief though.",3,white-widow

Reighly,"Rolled it up in hemp rolling paper, busted out the hemp wick and took the first draw, and I was hooked. Smooth hits complement it's many flavors, didn't even realize I had taken such a big hit. As I exhaled I expected it to hit me like so many of the heavy hitters, considering this strains fame is right up there with the best. Although, the &quot;high&quot; effect hit just a few mins later easing you into a happy, artistic feeling. This strain is a much try for novice-seasoned smokers, medicated or recreational, it's smooth easy, and makes you feel just right! ",4,white-widow
herrgumby,One of the few strains to rate a 9 in my book.  As Billy Idol used to sing &quot;It's a nice day for a white widow&quot; or was that wedding - I need more medicine.,4,white-widow
Garmstrong,"First hit: Amazing taste. Very smooth smoke, some coughing nearing the end of my exhale. Eyes feel like they are starting to dry already.   Within 5 minutes, ears starting to plug up a little bit.  Starting to feel uplifted and stress-free.  Second hit: Still tastes a mazing, almost better. Still some coughing nearing the end of the exhale, yet nonetheless still smooth hits. Possibly great for super hits.   Within 7 minutes, my head is starting to feel like it's a fishbowl full of water in a tilting room. Serious euphoria. Ah, the lump in the throat!! Yes!!! I haven;'t felt this since I started smoking weed for the first time. This is going to be very similar to my first time. Yes... So excited. You should be too, son!!!  I am singing &quot;Plush&quot; by STP and my vocals are actually better than usual..   12 minutes since first hit. I literally feel like I have taken 7 hits but have only taken 3.. Wow.  2nd bowl (Keep in mind, I pack pretty small bowls. Way less than even a quarter a gram, and I am totally getting smoshed on this shit).  Nxt hit, fourth I think, I'm not even kidding, it tastes like a real banana has aerated itself into my mouth!!  I am fucking high, Or almost there. ;D   Jesus christ fifth hit. I definitely ate a fucking banana fruit candy thingies that used to be awesome in the 90s. RUNTS MAN!!!!!!!!  Jesus I am high!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      ",5,white-widow
naynaywilliams,I have chronic pain and PTSD along with a few other things but I needed a strand that was uplifting that had me motivated during the day when the pain was so unbearable as a medical user I have found the strand very earthy with a slight hint of mask and woody flavorNever have I coughed with the strand and Iâ€™m a user of 20+ years but this is my go to Strahan when things are so unbearable for me you can be creative happy and relaxed all at the same time,5,white-widow
dmt_xyz,"Honestly one of the BEST strains I have ever had the opportunity to get my hands on. This review is based off the last 12 hours of 'blazing' down on this. Will say, pre-smoke, that I was feeling really down, not in the mood for anything, and unable to think up ideas for my art. After smoking this, fifteen minutes rolled by (time till effect is varied by tolerance) and I immediately felt like getting up and going for a walk. Especially with the beautiful white scenery in this year's winter, the euphoria and extreme happiness/tingling from this strain gave a beautiful outlook to everything and promoted random but beautiful ideas. Immediate cure for a rough day/week/life. For users who want a tolerance suggestion; low-tol - I recommend trying a few weaker buds before hand so this strain doesn't 'slap' you in the face and possibly cause paranoia. For high-tol and especially people who can mentally handle very strong highs I say jump right in and try it.",4,white-widow
Sapphyy,"White Widow, Oh what a glorious strain. I picked up gram of WW while I was in getting some other medicine and was BLOWN AWAY. I've heard some amazing things about it and also read some reviews on here earlier. Yet it still caught me off gaurd to be quite honest. I'm a pretty experienced toker who has tried many different strains but White Widow has very abruptly made its way into my Top 5. A super heady high paired with intense muscle relaxation. Also seemed to be very focused. Very good strain to use when just trying to relax and wind down. Stress Relieving and Pain Relieving. If you have the chance to get your hands on some White Widow. DO IT.",4,white-widow

HudsonCole,Might be one of Americaâ€™s greatest unsung exports as far as I am concerned.   For me- this is the perfect social smoke. I always want this if I am ever going out. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m floating around in a lazy boy talking to everyone with no anxiety and complete ease.   Very emotionally open and music sounds amazing. So amazing. Good for creative things or even as somewhat an alternative to Adderoll (for me).   Iâ€™d also recommend this for psycho work. If you want fantastic session doing some deep self work and observing with ego defense way down- Iâ€™d recommend talking on the downside of this high. Iâ€™m sure it sounds â€œhokeyâ€ù but this strain almost makes me an out of body observer to the world and myself. I donâ€™t know if makes sense to others?   There is a stoner proverb to the effect :  â€œWhen I smoke.  I donâ€™t eat. I taste.  I donâ€™t look. I see. I donâ€™t hear. I listen  I donâ€™t touch. I fell. I donâ€™t do. I experience.

RavenBanes,"This is yet another of my neighborhood shops $5 a gram strains. Its fantastic too. Very potent, never seen it below 28% THC. This is one of my go to strains when I'm poor (which is most of the time). For me it doesn't knock me on my butt indica, but it in combination with a high CBD strain, my chronic pain is almost gone. Because of Marijuana and other ways of THC and CBD intake, I have been able to stay off painkillers for quite some time now and not be a zombie with my family.",5,white-widow

Dryland2012,"White Widow is the MODEL hybrid. The 50/50 Indica, Sativa balance comes through in the high--half body effects, half heady effects. You know the first time you ever toked? That floaty feeling after the first ever hit where your body and mind floated together as one, yet you were a 3rd party outsider watching all this madness take place? What is the meaning of life?

DiscordedDiscord,"Honestly one of the best strains i have ever had. Very relaxing but gives you this nice boost of euphoria, creativity, and energy. A bit of everything which makes this strain amazing, as someone who suffers from a panic/anxiety disorder and commonly had panic attacks or a &quot;bad buzz&quot; from smoking too much, i can safely say that i've been able to smoke this strain as much as i want and i have never had a single anxiety kick. This strain become one of my favourite's very fast and would highly recommend for anyone",5,white-widow
mattny,"one of the more potent hybrids I've come across. Unmistakably pungent nuances of cedar, sour fruit and pine. Through my vaporizer I could detect and taste these wonderful essential oils. The effect is an eminating buzz that reverberates from the head to the lower body, a true toe tingler. Functional, creative, uplifting, a complete mind shifter. I find white widow fantastic for easing depression, pain, stomach ailments and fatigue while increasing my appetite. Great all around hybrid herb",5,white-widow
inthewild,Such an awesome sativa. I think this may well be the first sativa type strain that I really like. I usually smoke to relax and get ready for bed. Usually I'm &quot;sensitive&quot; to sativa. I generally get way to anxious and have had a couple panic attacks. This bud however was stimulating but didn't make me feel like my head was going to explode. I felt focused and energized. I had no idea sativa could be so complementary to a busy day. I wish all sativa hit me like this.,5,white-widow

I smoked half a bowl and was escorted to the pinnacle of happiness and amazement.  I had no idea that a plant could make you feel so good. Euphoric. Happy. Intense but not overly. It was a truly beautiful experience. Didn't make me super sleepy. Or hungry. It aroused the shit out of me about 45 mins in. This should be called the sex strain. Wow. This strain should be sacred. That's how special it is.  White widow is in a class of its own.",5,white-widow

Cryrste,"I recently tried this strain from my local dispensary, Cannabliss of Talihina, OK. I needed a few grams to get me by a few days until I made a trip to my favorite dispensary a town away. Perfect opportunity to try something new! Anywho...This strain is really great for arthritis pain &amp; physical relaxation with the added benefit of a cerebral buzz. It started in my face/head then spread pleasant tingles throughout my body. I didnâ€™t feel any jolt of energy or motivation, just a relaxed peaceful zen of sorts. The smell was pleasantly pungent (kind of skuny &amp; sweet) &amp; the buds were tight &amp; beautifully frosty. It smoked a little warm (could be just a little dry or maybe not perfectly cured yet) but it didnâ€™t make me cough up a lung...definitely smoother than other strains Iâ€™ve smoked.

Whether itâ€™s de-stressing after a long day and you just wanna be cotch, or maybe getting a bit creative and writing some barz, or playing really well on a game (fortnite) or getting artsy... or going to the extremes, it can cure your depression and help you think in better more positive ways, and itâ€™s wonderful for chronic pain or headaches. What ever you are doing whilst smoking white widow I can guarantee that that activity will be so much more enjoyable with this beautiful strain.

cbr1000rr1,"veteran smoker and grower here.... the stuff we get at the dispos around here has nothing on this white widow i grow outdoors in the blazing hot sun all summer. i got the white widow seed as a freebie from Canuk Seeds (yea never heard of them before until now). grew outdoors in fox farms ocean forest soil, and filtered tap water. used fox farm trio nutrients when flowering started (nothing but water before then). the trio is tiger bloom, big bloom, and grow big and the feeding schedule is online. anyways, this plant ended up being one of the strongest i've ever grown or smoked in a long time. i'd say it's about 60 sativa/40 indica, maybe more sativa but hits you in the eyes big time, really heady and lasts for a long time, i'm talking 3-4 hours and still feel a bit the next morning... it's only been drying for 10 day so the cure hasn't even began. big buds (not like them pimpy nugs you get at the dispos), old skool taste, nothing special on that but this stuff reaks you can smell it a mile away and it is super super sticky, burns pretty good and will get better as it cures.. heady, a bit of body buzz, uplifting maybe a slight bit racy.... it's the bomb for sure.",5,white-widow

Euphoria is the primary function of acquiring something like this, and it seems to have a very high peak that I have not yet attained. Excellent stuff.",4,white-widow
Aaro,"White Widow is probably my favorite sativa I have smoked so far. It has an amazing smell, full of crystals, soft, and slightly sticky. The smoke itself is really smooth, out of a bubbler or pipe, and has a mellow taste. Effects can be felt between 5-10 mins, and last up to 1.5 hours. Uplifting, euphoric, and smiley high. Energy and creativeness are felt as well. A great social high that lives up to the hype. ",4,white-widow

She's a strong little flower, and frosty, i mean FROSTY! Stickiest nugs iv'e ever personally handled.   Just holding a nug up to the light and you can see the oily goodness, set inside of the trichomes just glistening away in the light. There is a reason they call this stuff white widow.   Initial high goes right to the head, and pretty fast. Mine was mid harvest, i can tell by the cloudy trichomes. The high is soaring and long lasting, very talkative (i'm driving my wife nuts lol) It makes me feel very creative and ready to produce content, write or workout.   The aroma is incredible, extremely strong. I open it up and across the house i'm hearing complaints XD  Very citrusy and sour on the nose with an earthy overtone.

1taste,Honestly this is not a favourite of mine. Yes it generally does the job of getting you high but for me there is something missing about it. I felt sort of meh about the experience. It felt good but nothing to write home about. If I had some or a friend had some and said letâ€™s go smoke I wouldnâ€™t be looking forward to it as much as other strains.  I didnâ€™t feel the euphoria or as happy as some other strains but it was relaxing and I did feel uplifted. I do like a Sativa and I smoke it for the properties of a Sativa but for me this didnâ€™t do it.  I give it 3 stars as I would smoke it again if someone offered me some and overall itâ€™s fine but I wouldnâ€™t be going out and buying it again.  I was smoking this in bud form and from a pipe. Iâ€™ve been smoking for about a year and recently more daily. ,3,white-widow

Bartndk,"This is quite a story   Back in the beginning when i just started smoking, i had the tendency to go quite nuts with whatever strain i got hands on.   And so on, one rainy evening after eveninglessons i said to a friend of me, who did not smoke, i wanted to smoke.  So after school we went to the coffeeshop, bought a gram of white widowÂ and rolled a fat joint.  Stupid enough to smoke the whole joint, i did, and at first it wasn't that bad.  Strong euphoric high, big wide smile on my face and far from couch-locked.  I where even able to catch te bus for my friend so he could get home!  So there i'm standing, alone with 0.5 gram of hard lessons to never forget,Â i continued to smoke.Â   Walked inside the train station, stil smoking and starting to get quite uncomfortable.   Actually you can say i began to get badshit paranoid, trew my small leftover away and noticed people looking.  Maby they weren't looking, maybe did.  Constantly repeating the question, i found myself unable to find my train...  Wondering around, paranoia and the devastating high beginning to tear my mind lose from my brain, i saw i had my phone in my hand, and my friend who left a hour ago was calling me.Â   Picking up the callÂ i heard his voice slightly panicked, asking where i am,Â i looked around and said: &quot;no Idea, Bram&quot;.  At that moment my phone died.  Trying to keep my shit togetherÂ i continued wondering around, whatever world my high ass was cast at,Â i sad down on a bench on the station.  Noticing i fell in anÂ intens deep trance,Â i stood up and for what ever reason got in the first train i saw. The wrong one obviously.  But in whatever wayÂ god creates wonders, my friend was there outside the window!  I sprinted outside the train and almost body slammed my 120 kg weighing friend against the floor whenÂ i hugged him and maby even let a tear of releave.   He was there with his dad to bring me home al save and verry f*cking wise to never smoke so much weed again.   Thank you bram  ",5,white-widow
blackcoffeekush,"The taste is pleasant although it's not like a really anything outstanding. Kind of like vanilla wood, I do like it (permafrost strain also tastes like this). White Widow is my favorite &quot;get it done strain&quot;. It's uplifting like a sativa, but still has a little bit of body high and relaxing effect (just a tiny amount though). It seems like what the perfect Sativa should be to me. I consider it a sativa as far as effects, but not way too clean like some sativas. It's still more clear headed than Durban Poison, and Vortex and some other &quot;stony&quot; Sativas. White Widow is even more clear headed than Mau Waui, which is also a Sativa. Which is also White Widow's only downside; it doesn't really get you relaxed and sleepy before bed, it's not good for insomina like a good indica such as UW Purple or Pitbull. And the stony Sativas I listed above would be better than this before bed. White Widow is a nice uplifting, happy, energetic strain, great for outdoor activities, or househould chores, getting stuff done, or just having fun! Some White Widows strains have CBD, but not all do. Enjoy!",5,white-widow

TeamScienceOttawa,"Another White Widow review? Absolutely when there's multiple growers offering it! The last White Widow review that I submitted was for a product grown by Canaca, but last week I noticed that OCS managed to grab a competitors version so I had to get some for a head to head comparison. This new batch I got was grown by Redecan, who's White Shark and Shiskaberry I've already tried. I'm not going to go over what I expect from a White Widow strain you can check my previous review for that, instead I'm just doing to discuss how this brand of White Widow compares to Canaca's. Overall the two offering are very comparable but the flower from Redecan was dryer than the batch I got from Canaca, and for that reason if I had to choose one over the other then I'd recommend Canaca's. But would I order Redecan's version again? Absolutely!",5,white-widow
Harrypothead87,"Back in the early 00's it was one of the big names and had a punch to prove it. It had a euphoric and happy effect, while also feeling nicely relaxed sometimes too relaxed depending on how well it was grown. Now it's just cheap commercial gear. Had it twice quite recently at two different coffeeshops. First time was a pure pre rolled joint and just didn't rate it and the second time was when a friend bought it. We both rolled one at same time and both would just not stay lit. Both of us are good rollers so we knew it wasn't us but managed to see the funny side and we're quite relieved considering he only got a 1g",3,white-widow
Tones06,"Bought a HQ off the OCS website. 18.8%THC  First impressions: The scent isn't as dank as I thought. Light on the nose, earthy and slight pine. 4 large nugs, not tightly wound, but still dense. Thick flakes at the bottom as a result from shifting in transport.  At first, the bud itself is looks like it isn't dusted in trichomes, but under a bright light you can see it is dusted like fine powder all over. The pistils are a solid dark copper colour which are tightly wound in and out of the bud.   The blaze: Smooth. No cough reflex, the high starts with the head. You might get a little giggly or even find mundane things funny. But suddenly your thoughts wane to another thought and idea. I feel like the focus flows like a leaf down a stream. And that's when you notice the body tingles which really helps if you have inflammation or tense muscles. At this point your body feels like warm butter, the indica side starts to kick in.  Now you wanna feel more comfortable than you are now, so you head to the couch, where you'll lock yourself in. If you have snacks around, this is likely where you'll eat em cause a slight hunger buzz happens. You can fight through it, nothing intense, but all will power goes out the door if snacks are around. Now sit back and relax to netflicks, cause after a few shows, you're going to bed in a real good mellow.",5,white-widow

This strain is cerebral as it clears the mind of any fog and bring full clarity to the activities at hand.  It also gives a mild body high that gives you that nice warm mellow feeling.

Codyloc915,"I was a stoner in my teens and thought this was going to be the best strain I ever had when I tried it. When I finally tried it, it was like mid grade to me that made me paranoid. I did finish 3.5 grams of this flower (not all at once) throughout 3 months time and I had about the same effects. I would get the euphoria giggly feeling and then check my blinds like 5 times an hour lol! I would 100% recommend this flower  if you donâ€™t have high anxiety because of everything you experience except the paranoia. ",3,white-widow
NightlifeVixen,"Medium/moderate high. You are for sure extremely talkative and cannot stand to sit down and want to move. I have muscle spasms, horrible migraine and chronic pain.

Giggling should be a warned side effect as well since I could not stop for over an hour.",5,white-widow

OneWhitePigeon,"After smoking GD Purple for a few days, I have to say, I was definitely ready for a little less housekeeping. Perhaps it is pent-up anxiety that leads me to housekeeping when I smoke, but I was looking for something a little less 'Power of PineSol'.   Most people can smoke and sit, but me? I'm up, scrubbing, cleaning, hosing things down. Doesn't matter if it is Indica, Sativa, or Hybrid. Still searching for that sit-down-and-chill weed. I digress.   So, on to White Widow. I do like this one, and will definitely use it again and again, but it is almost as if two sides of me are rebelling. &quot;Sit.&quot; becons my tired side. &quot;Let's just chill.&quot; The other side says &quot;Hey, it would take ten minutes to fix the vacuum cleaner, let's give it a shot, eh?&quot;  A bit rough on the lungs if you take too much, so go easy, or you'll be coughing, though not for long.   The high didn't seem to last that long, though I'm still in the mood to do more housekeeping. A good one for when you want to get things done, but not in a panic. Slow down, and complete projects. Nice.",4,white-widow
oscarmike762,"White widow is a good strain for outdoor smoking; laid back environments go well with the high. Has the sativa smell to it, other than that smells great. Has a very good body high, not so great with pain, does take the edge off though. All in all for taste, smell, medicinal benefits, and euphoria I give a 4/5.",4,white-widow

connorbonvillain,"Wonderful. I became energetic, giggly, talkative, and relaxed. I deal with general anxiety and weed tends to trigger that / make it worse, but surprisingly I had a good time _Ÿ˜‚I would consider this medicinal for me.  I only had a couple puffs, so I'm not sure how I'd react if I smoked more.  But it's not common for me to become a social butterfly when smoking, so I'm looking forward to getting to know this strain.",5,white-widow

earlofamerica,"This review is for the Pyramid Prism PAX Pod. The taste reminded me of how a store that sold wicker goods smelled when I was a child--like a sweet perfumed wood. I wasn't overly impressed with this strain when I tried the flower but that was probably due to my own THC tolerance. THIS was very nice. It starts off with a gentle easiness in the eyes and just spreads throughout the body with time. The physical effect isn't one that leaves you feeling tired, just feeling relaxed and good. Mentally, I feel happy and much more carefree than I did half an hour ago. Like the physical effects, this is gentle and not excessively intense like some sativas can get. I can now totally understand why so many people love this strain. IMHO, it's right up there with Bruce Banner in terms of good strains to hang out and smoke with friends--no tiredness or paranoia, just a good ol' time.",5,white-widow

Not a very dense bud structure....covered in sugar trics...and sticky greens.....low smelling in grow area, handles nutes well and likes normal waterings....I like this strain because it is the perfect high.... Slow creeper with a up front cerebral buzz...then tapers off to a warm comfort zone body high....can get very narcotic couch lock about a hour in....makes you sleepy and ready for a refreshing sleep....Heavy on the eyes for sure......You need 4 puffs Max for liftoff.... definitely can taper off any minor pains or aggravated muscles and joints.....Not a super high percent on THC but does not disappoint.... Sometimes the 25% plus strains get the motor neuron functions off balance , this is a perfect middle",5,white-widow
gordosanchz77,Flavorful ,5,white-widow
Topherwillow,"White Widow definitely lives up to her name. After a small joint (my tolerance is low) she wrapped me right up into her web. This strain is now my #1. I always wanted to smoke White Widow and thanks to my state going medicinal, I'm able to. The high is steady going up and steady going down but at the plateau of the high it's almost numbing throughout my body and I'm relaxed, no pain, thoughts slow down, depression fades... I'm able to laugh and feel lighter... overall relieved. When White Widow is done with you she leaves you wanting more and I can't smoke anymore or I won't wake up for work. I have to be thoughtful of the strains I smoke bc some of them increase my anxiety and paranoia... Not White Widow and believe me I am very lightweight after not smoking for many years. Give White Widow a try... start small and work your way up if you're similar to me. Enjoy.",5,white-widow
420_Kitten,"I bought an eight from Canaca, Canadian LP. Buds were small but tight, well trimmed with minimal stem. The earthy, skunky smell is promenent as soon as you open your container. The high is relatively quick to hit with a strong sense of euphoria. I thought that the THC was a little low for such a famous strain, but it didnt matter because the high definitely lives up to its reputation. I would recommend this strain for both recreational and medicinal use.",4,white-widow

RayG74,"Not a regular smoker. One heavy vape hit will give me drunk like head buzz, energy so I start doing things that are not fun thinking that they are. It does get me and my wife hungry.

InTheMorning,"White window...is a creeper, quite literally and figuratively. Whenever I am not relying on someone elseâ€™s supply or hitting anyone elseâ€™s weed it is always usually white widow. And it always does a good job of taking care of me in the kindest way. The highway is euphoric without being overwhelming, uplifting without being egocentric, and sociable without being self conscious.  He nugs are beautiful with a smattering of Crystal on the outside with a dark orange strain in interwoven around the deep green nug. The smell to me has always been a bit on the Piney side and incredibly strong but I have had very different experiences with white widow but each one has always been quite pugnacious And memorable. Highly recommend the strain!",5,white-widow

thcguruv,"I grew the auto-flower White Widow from Crop King Seeds. It was fairly easy to grow and good sized buds as well.   The smell is somewhat earthy sweet yet has an undertone of a skunky/sour note. I find you do not need to much of this weed as it has a good kick to it. I find the smoke somewhat of the rougher side (yet still tastes good) and belive this is due to the amount of tricomes on it.   The effects are very cerberial and can be somewhat powerful. This strain is Indica dominant and I find it really good for sleeping on. I like smaller doses during the day if I need to do anything that requires concentration or critical thought. Finally, I find this straing good as I moke it daily and always gets me buzzed.",5,white-widow

Serpentethyx,"One of my favorite strains not only because of uplifting, energetic and intense euphoric experience I had but also that these nugs were so caked with crystals, while grinding them it filled the room with a flowery aroma that was quite therapeutic alone by the smell actually...

xpattycakes,tried this about a year ago a couple times and recently tried it again! forgot how much i liked the high off this weed. this strain will definitely make you want to do something productive. i love the smell of it for some reason lol. will definitely smoke again. all my paranoia and anxiety is gone - absolutely wonderful. i recommend to those for a uplifting experience!,5,white-widow
littlerivers,"I tend to get super bad tension headaches and killer neck pain from years of thrashing my head around playing in a rock band, and this really helps all those tensed up muscles relax and just melt. I usually vape this (dry herb) and five or six hits will leave you feeling good for awhile. It also has the benefit of not making you feel or act too high. I vaped about .25 gram and my wife didnâ€™t even know, she was soooo surprised when I told her. So if youâ€™re looking for just a good strain to help you relax without making you feel too high or get locked to the couch, I would try this out.",4,white-widow

Oliviaroxhard,This is my favorite but oldy strain. The crystals and the color green it is a beautiful plant. This is a tricky one to say how it will affect you. It depends on how much weed you smoke first off and for how long. It also depends on how much you smoke of white widow and also again how often and how long you've been smoking this magical strain. I miss this strain being around. It's hard to come by in some &quot;states&quot; ;) but whenever I do get a chance to smoke white widow I am the happiest person in the world. This is a very creative and happy strain. I think some cannot handle the effects after an hour you may get less creative and more talkative about who knows what... maybe how the universe first began lol. I think you get it. This is MY FAV OLDY STRAIN! Good token folks xoxo,5,white-widow

nathan.felix,"Overall I'd have to say this was a great strain experience, mixed with a great flavor this strain has a wonderful scent &amp; euphoria. It doesn't make you tired, &amp; like others said you will be cleaning with the energy you do get. This would be a great strain to smoke before doing something like meditation or yoga, painting, ect. What I liked about this strain was that it relaxed me, but it didn't make me sleep or couch locked all day.",5,white-widow

lotega,"I can't yet speak to what it's like to get lit off this strain, but I've never found a more perfect daytime microdose strain. It evens my mood (calming my anxiety while lightly boosting my energy), relieves muscle tension/pain, and calms my stomach -- all while barely effecting my mental capacity (if anything it might make me more focused).  And I can't forget to mention the amazing taste. Piney, spicey, earthy, and yet with a wonderful sweetness! I'm surprised I haven't got lit off this stuff yet, because that flavor makes me want to take hit after hit!",5,white-widow
SirSparky,"Filthy amounts of long orange hairs dominate the surface of the flower along with dark and pale green calyxes covered in frosty trichomes. The smell is pungent with a pronounced fuel and lime aroma. The taste is light, earthy, almost woodsy, with a mellow, sweet-bark and hash aftertaste. The smoke is curious, some hits are super-smooth and others have more bite, not just in the lungs but the throat as well. The high is interesting, too. Itâ€™s heady but not so invigorating like some sativas (Durban poison or Green Crack, for example). Itâ€™s mostly just an incredible ability to focus. The body buzz, which sets in about a hot minute after, is relaxing but not intense . I have a heightened sense of awareness and contentment. Not a lot of pain relief, so look for other strains for that, just a feeling of well-being. This could be used to clean the house, create artwork or music, go on a nature walk or enjoy a conversation with good friends. Because it doesnâ€™t mess with your senses it could be a great first strain! It makes me drowsy after the first hour or so so a better â€œafter workâ€ù experience for beginners while the level of focus and creativ burst will be perfect for the experienced userâ€™s â€˜wake and bake.â€™  This one wonâ€™t blow your mind but thereâ€™s times thatâ€™s just what the doctor ordered. For a similar experience plus pain relief, try Blackjack instead!",4,white-widow
Gonatural1980,"The first thing I noticed was what a tasty strain this is, and how mild the smoke was in my particular bong. It was relatively smooth and almost tasted like pineapple.  Then I noticed the amazing buzz that came almost right after my first hit. I am a fairly heavy smoker with a very high tolerance, and I felt the effects immediately.  Very happy,  relaxed but motivated,  talkative and productive. This is now my favorite strain",5,white-widow

therothchildstrain,"I suffer from derealization and depersonalization, I haven't taken prescription meds for every political reason possible and due to the plethora of negative side effects so I've been medicating with dear old canabis for a while. This strain is the best day time strain I've ever tried. It's the only strain that gives me the giggles, and makes everything enjoyable even when my perception on reality acts up. The smoke was a combo you sweet and harsh, tasted bland but in a good way, and the effects hit instantly. Weather I'm in class or driving off on a trip it leaves me in a perfect state of mind to do my daily rut but puts a film of enjoy-ability on it. Overall if you're looking for something to ease stress, slap a smile on your face, and get you working with some creative euphoria then this is the strain for you! ",4,pineapple-express
FirstSergeant,"Pineapple Express, for me, is one of the top sativa's available. First, I'm a retired Army First Sergeant...I'm pretty banged-up with a spinal cord injury, and a bad anxiety disorder (they call it PTSD. Pineapple Express, especially the sample I had from Altitude Organic, is very very reisiny. The green bud (with dark veins) produces the worst resin residue you'll ever have on your fingers. Soap/ water won't get it off...use isopropyl or a handy rag. This super sativa isn't as stringy as green crack/golden goat...which makes rolling/burning a lot easier. The high is strong, but much more 'enjoyable' than other super-sativa's. I was energized, but not nearly as hyper as similar strains. You'll get 'all' the energy...but with a 'much'  more euphoric/rewarding feeling. This is perfect for 'daytime' medicinal needs, and to other fellow soldiers suffering with anxiety... Altitude's Pineapple Express will bring you more relief than any Xanex/Klonopin tablet could ever bring. Trust me...my case is severe, and this is my day/evening cure.",5,pineapple-express
smokingagain,"After 30 years of not smoking weed, I stopped by a dispensary in Colorado to pick out weed for my first high in ages. The helpful budtender pointed me to Pineapple Express, which he said would be a great return to weed. Boy, was he right! Being a hybrid, it was a perfect sativa/indica blend of mellow and alertness. It had an awesome taste and smoked from my new pipe soooo smoothly! After taking it slow with a few deep tokes, I instantly got that familiar sweet high I last experienced 30 years ago! A pleasant laid back chill with absolutely no paranoia. A fantastic choice I won't forget, and I am so glad this strain was my reintroduction to getting high again! Can't wait for my next high with this awesome strain!",5,pineapple-express
Yahoo420,"Great strain to use at any time. Remedy's symptoms from a handful of mental conditions, just like its made to do. Anybody living with mental stress should try this strain, in order to be able to calm down the body and nervous system but also stimulate the mind enough that focusing isn't as hard as after using a heavy indica for relaxation. I feel confident yet relaxed enough to be calm after using this strain. Perfect combination of strains to create a mild cerebral high along with a heightened sense of creativity in the light of total relaxation in mind and body.",5,pineapple-express
silenteasy,"Pineapple Express: took awhile to get this strain so the anticipation was intense, nonetheless, nice strain. Didn't blow me away, however I did feel both awake but EXTREMELY relaxed. Functional, but slow. Feels almost indica til you get up and stretch; and what's wrong with a nice stretch? Little munchies, nice mood booster, giggly, &amp; pretty level headed. Only big downside I saw was my eyes drooped (I literally laughed at that word for 20 seconds) &amp; made me appear more high than I actually was.

I've tried strains from CO and Seattle. where the CO buds were small and tight and bright green (popcorn buds), the Seattle strain is big fat red haired dark and light green monster nug.  it is what a sativa should be.  it's an intense quick hitting heady high (no couch potato) that is uplifting and euphoric. taste ranges from fruity, pineapple of course, earthy, with hints of pine or wood.  helps motivate.  gives you a serious appetite.  introspective and creative.  my.fav.sativa.  you will not be disappointed.",5,pineapple-express

OCWeedReview,"After the release of the popular stoner flick by the same name, many people assumed that Pineapple Express was a fictional strain, but the truth is it is a very real bud, a cross between Trainwreck and Hawaiian, both heavily influenced by sativa genes.  It is this background that makes Pineapple Express such a popular strain.  The jubilant sativa high can completely change your day and is very different from the mostly indica based strains popular on market.  You will want this medication in your life, and you will become giddy when you see it on a menu.    Pineapple Express is a shiny bud, bright with trichromes, making for a pale green bud.  Juxtaposed against this pastel flower are orange hairs grouped in thick clumps.  When I broke it up, a fine layer of kief was left on the bottom of my dish, speaking to the number of crystals covering these buds.  The smell of this strain is sweet and succulent and lingered on my fingers long after I handled it.  There is a mouth watering effect when the tropical aroma is deeply inhaled.  While pineapple is assumed, it is more mango and pear: both luscious and juicy.  Tearing into this bud is like ripping into an off-the-branch-fresh fruit.  The flavor, although sweet in the green hit, is astringent in the exhale and can be harsh.  This can be the case with some sativas types.    Although Pineapple Express has some Afghani indica in its Trainwreck heritage, this is a predominantly sativa high.  Itâ€™s been touted as the happiest of highs--completely relaxed and carefree.  Medicating with Pineapple Express is a bit like going on vacation.  Even though it is mellow and cheerful, there is little chance you are going to get much work done.  This strain is distracting, and I had a hard time achieving much of anything.  It is much better enjoyed when responsibility can be shelved and the high can truly be enjoyed.  Iâ€™d strongly recommend this strain as an effective antidepressant.  It helps you forget yourself and unwind.  In todayâ€™s hectic world, it can be your stolen moment to center yourself.  http://ocweedreview.wordpress.com/",3,pineapple-express
pineapple4u,Ermahgerd I absolutely love this strain. It makes me so happy and I literally get so much housework done. I can accomplish anything on Pineapple Express while still enjoying a nice head high and the giggles. I get very talkative on this strain and come up with some genius ideas and am able to think about things in a new light. Almost like being able to think freely without the stresses of life taking over. Love it! ,5,pineapple-express
Emandudeguy,"Incredible. Makes life seem so much better. One of the best strains for depression in my mind. The high is quite psychadelic, and really enhances things like music and movies. Great to have with friends. If you try this on your first time you will love cannabis forever.",5,pineapple-express
Fargo123,"This cannabis is very special because it causes people to snap out of their anxious, worrying state of mind and out of their robotic like personality and it makes them come back into the present moment. You can see moment when the person snaps back into being in the present moment. Smells slightly like pineapples. Is very strong (strength maybe 9.0/10) and makes me very hungry. This pot has a higher potential of forming a habit because it is of such high quality.",5,pineapple-express
showhadoing,"Reliably makes things look different.  The world around me looks more artistic and vintage and rustic.  Strong creative vibes with this strain.

Makes me feel happy and peaceful.",5,pineapple-express
nicagreen,"I loved this strain and it's been some time since I've had some Pex :(   It's a highly euphoric almost psychedelic strain!

After trying multiple strains with mixed results, this beauty took the gold. No anxiety spikes, no reality disconnection, and (as an unexpected bonus) better sex. If anyone has similar issues and hasn't tried Pineapple Express, I highly reccomend it!",5,pineapple-express

dean.winchester,"Forget the movie, this strain deserves much more. By far my favorite strain I've ever smoked, the bud I got from DANK was incredible. Beautiful clusters of flowery buds pretty light compared to other strains. I used a pipe and ripped off about 3 bowls. Totally took away any pain or my PTSD symptoms, i was surprised that a hybrid worked with PTSD, I usually only have luck with indicas. The high was really nice, i was able to go to work and function but still maintain a very enjoyable high. Just try it you will love it.",5,pineapple-express
ryan472,"Pineapple Express is definitely in my top 5's. Very visual high, very natural, made nature look beautiful. I walked down to my lake around 7, sun was setting and the water was crystal clear. Walked back up, felt very social. So i called my brother and asked if he wanted to try it. He did,  and we shared 1.5 in a bowl. The bud itself was very squishy, sticky bud. After smoking more, my high was intensified. Overall, i enjoy this strain very much. I recommend this to either beginners or experienced smokers. Have fun!",4,pineapple-express
kyleGHAD,"Pineapple Express... I was browsing a new (to me) dispensary, and found this strain in real life! For quite some time (being a small town New Yorker) the name thing didn't mean anything to me, and the movie was great, but I didn't realize it was an actual bud. So I got it. As soon as I saw the name I knew I wanted it, for the namesake alone. However, it is in shatter form, and a little dark in color, but as a new &quot;dabber&quot; this has been a great strain for me to learn with and just enjoy. I did take a dab before I started writing this, and the high is definitely a creeper high. Took ~5-10 minutes for full effect, and now I'm just stoked on life. Sipping some coffee and lounging around as I get ready for the day (first day of online classes) I can tell this strain will not affect my energy levels (not sedating/drowsy) but will keep me extremely focused and beyond joyous. It's definitely a feel good, happy high that I can enjoy time and time again. I would recommend this to anyone ever. Maybe just start with some flower, cz this shatter is bomb. In which I also hope to find this in flower, as that puts a true bud to the name for me! SMOKE SOME PINEAPPLE EXPRESS AND WATCH PINEAPPLE EXPRESS!! ",5,pineapple-express
dmurka,"Despite the many comments saying that it is a great day time high, I think it has been overlooked as a bud to smoke at night. Pineapple Express is such a happy weed.

Always highly potent. 4.5/5",4,pineapple-express
Anonymous,"Just picked up a 1/2 pound of this stuff from my buddy a couple days ago. I was smoking a joint of it while writing the review so it should be pretty spot on haha. The buds are sticky/resiney, dense and pretty large. Big fat chunky thangs. The high is great I am really impressed with the quality. Because at first glance the bud seems a little bland if I might say, but once you break it open and smell that sweet smell and feel the resin sticking to you're fingers you know what you're in for.  It has a real earthy sweet taste to it and it burns quiet well in a bong, nice thick clouds. It's pretty hard hitting but you instantly feel it flush from you head down, droopy eyes are what a lot of my friends that have smoke it have said. It's a pretty lazy high as well. Overall the bud is great and I can't wait to get through this batch to see what's next. Though I will not complain if it's more of the Pineapple. :D",4,pineapple-express
LeMangeLumiere,"I cannot say enough about this strain. Holy shit. This is my new favorite strain. I got a gram of this for free as a first-time patient at a local dispensary, and I am SO glad I grabbed this instead of the Indica I was looking at right next to it.  For one thing, the smell and flavor are on point. Pineapple Express lives up to its tropical, fruity-sounding name; each hit brought a strong taste of a tropical fruit cocktail, with earthy/woody undertones to even out some of the sweetness. It hits VERY smoothly (through a bong at least), and is an all-around pleasant smoke. Typically I like to vent my room well after I smoke weed, since the smell can linger a bit much, but I don't mind the lingering scent of this strain; it really is quite sweet and fruity. Reminds me of smoking cannabis in paradise!  When I smoked this, I smoked it out of the relatively large bowl of my brand-new bong. I'd only smoked out of it once before, and I only smoked maybe half a bowl, since that's all I had left in my grinder at the time. It was some God's Gift, so it hit me pretty fast and knocked me out; was a great high though, and that being my first time ever smoking out of a bong and having such a great experience, I was super excited to try this new strain (a popular one of Hollywood fame) for the first time using a bong. It was Friday night, after work, and Friday nights are usually my stoner nights where I get high and let my stress of the week burn away with the bowl... therefore, I packed a pretty full bowl.  The bowl wasn't even finished and I was gone. And by gone, I mean off in another dimension, another pocket of time separate from that of the rest of the world. One minute seemed like ten, it seemed like I was floating in a blissful, carefree cloud. My body was totally relaxed, but my mind was active, flying free. It. Felt. Amazing. I was completely separated from my pain, completely separated from the stress of the work week. I was existing in my own little paradise without a care in the world (which is absolutely, insanely remarkable considering how I am usually in a constant state of anxiety over everything ever). I pushed myself to polish off the bowl and I am so glad I did, because this feeling only grew. I was super fucking high. Probably too high, but I didn't have that &quot;too high&quot; feeling. I just felt great.  Another thing that was absolutely amazing about the high produced by this strain is that it stimulated my imagination to the point of extreme clarity. Like... I'm talking VIVID visualization. Not hallucination or anything like that (I had complete control over what I was picturing as well), but if I tried imagining something, the image or sensation would come to me very easily and very clearly. I do practice witchcraft as part of my spirituality, and visualization is a very important part of this. I feel that smoking some of this could easily bring my practice to new heights. I also absolutely would like to get a &quot;stoner journal&quot; for when I smoke strains like this, because just lying on my bed I came up with some pretty amazing creative writing/fantasy story ideas, and I would LOVE to be able to write them down and revisit them when I'm sober instead of just telling my boyfriend to remember them for me. Things just... came to life in my mind. Seriously. I cannot get over how vividly I was able to imagine visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli.  Which brings me to the next part of my review...  ***MATURE CONTENT, POSSIBLE TMI FOLLOWING***  This is DEFINITELY going to be one of my go-to sex strains. Idk if anyone else has experienced this while smoking this strain, and maybe it was a mix of the high and my hormones being a bit out-of-whack... but along with that vivid imagery and visualization came a WHOLE lot of horniness. Of course I started thinking about a sexual dream I'd had the night before (and previously masturbated to) and it came back in vivid detail, both visually and in terms of practically being able to feel certain parts of my body being touched... Long story short, I had the BEST masturbation session I think I've ever had. I have never come so much in my life. I told my boyfriend about it (we're long distance at the moment) and he said he'd be open to possibly bringing cannabis into the bedroom after I described my experience; he's previously been pretty hesitant about it.  ***END MATURE CONTENT/TMI***  On top of all this, I don't think I experienced a single negative side effect. The high was unrivaled; when I started to come down I did get a bit tired, but it didn't hit me like a ton of bricks like it does with some strains. It just relaxed me enough for me to ease into bed and float off pleasantly to sleep. I had some pretty interesting dreams (actually interesting, like fun) and ended up sleeping VERY well and waking up feeling more refreshed than I've felt in a while. A lot of times when I wake up I feel like I hardly slept at all, even if I slept for 10+ hours; that was NOT the case after going to bed with this in my system. I slept very well, slept in, and woke up feeling totally rejuvenated and in an amazing mood. Best Saturday I've had in forever. I wish I felt this way every morning. Perhaps I'm going to have to make a nighttime ritual of smoking a generous bowl of Pineapple Express...  But yeah. Absolutely mind-blowing strain. If you want to create your own little slice of paradise with your high, you MUST pick this up. Every cannabis user should try some of this at least once in their lifetime.",5,pineapple-express
Genevieve_Pearle,"Vaped CO2 oil from Optimum. This is such a fun strain, giving a very bright and energetic creative high. I find myself gravitating to this strain when I feel like singing or playing an instrument. ",4,pineapple-express
yamabushi,"Pineapple Express, when people say certain strains are a &quot;creeper.&quot; They are talking about stuff like this. It is one sumbitch of a slow building high. I'd go so far as to say, hit another fast moving Sativa beforehand, then, add some Pineapple Express to stretch out your high. After one Arizer Air bowl/chamber I'm high, but relatively functional. Not feeling very creative, or, particularly  motivated to clean up the house. So far, not super impressed with Pineapple Express. Kinda bummed, definitely thinking I should have went with the Sour Diesel instead. If my opinion changes on Pineapple Express I'll update. Oh, did I mention I'm high on it right now? Well, I am, all pissed off like Andy Rooney going on weed tangents and shit. However, in the vast weed cornucopia that is the Mile High State I'd recommend many other strains before this.",3,pineapple-express
Monaliza,"All aboard the Pineapple Express, Sativa-Hybrid by Cresco!  â€œWelcome home dearâ€ù is my first thought as my younger lips touched the cart tip. Pineapple Express is a return to old times, longer days, family picnics and when all lead wasnâ€™t â€˜badâ€™.   With its linage in Trainwrek (Mexican, Thai &amp; Afghani) and Hawaiian, Pineapple Express is a strong sativa leaning Hybrid strain that knocks both your ass and your mind clear out of your body.  For me, a morning and afternoon train ride only.   Hereâ€™s the juice:  Cresco  #Cresco Yeltrah 500 mg CO2 cartridge from #TerraVida Holistic Centers THC: 63.48% THCA: 1.28% CBG: 0.87%  Daâ€™ Terps:  Terpinolene: 1.39% Anise, Ginger  Myrcene: 0.73% Lemongrass, Hops Limonene: 0.38% Lemon, Juniper  Pineapple Express is celebrated for calming muscle spasms, pain, depression, social anxiety- releaf and euphoria. It is not known for being able to accomplish tasks or meet deadlines.  Pineapple does not belong on pizza. But, when you open up and let the train in, smoked pineapple will become your new conductor of love. The first vapor drawn in unfolds a lightly snowed landscape with scattered pines and juniper bushes. Grilled pineapple skews your senses as it builds into a peppered tropical fruit salad in your mouth. *swallows* At the midpoint, anise and nutmeg flirt with hops and lime to round out the flavorful exhaust. You are left with fumes of lime accompanied by fallen corpses of over-toasted marshmallows on the damp forest floor.   Pineapple Express is a fantastic medicine for staying cheerful, happy, smiley, calm and awake.   Letâ€™s make it a party!  I will be pairing Pineapple Express with cranberry seltzer over muddled raspberry ice cubes. For a nosh, dim sum styled service of pickled vegetables, spicy cabbage brisket and thick- cut pieces of rosemary herbed roasted potatoes.

Lordhybrid,"Got the auto vers. from Barneys Farm, and what can I say.. Growing this one is really easy and fast, yield is also superb. It is definitely my new fav. strain by far! The taste and smell is unbelievable, fruity / exotic with a sure snare of pineapple, it's fresh and delicious!  The effects are huge and crazy, nearly psychedelic! Don't start your day with this one if your going to get social, cause it's really hard hitting! First time i tried this i couldn't believe how high i got, and started laughing only at that reason.  I could only believe none autos are more decent, yet this one rocks!   Only bad thing is like 2 week's before harvest it smells insanely, but not a typical smell, really sweet but strong smell, keep that in mind while growing it.",5,pineapple-express
animus303,"Pineapple Express is one of the most well balanced sativas ever bred. This strain has no traces of paranoia or anxiety that can be associated with sativas. The flavor is very fruity and sweet and the smoke is very smooth and becomes smoother with water filtration. This is a perfect smoke for any time of the day as it will not give you a heavily sedated feeling that occurs with indicas and high CBD strains. You can very easy accomplish your goals for the day on this strain and it certainly makes me more social and chatty with the strangers I encounter about my day. The color of the nugs is usually bright green with bright orange hairs, the colors really pop on these flows so beware dull and dark strains as they are not the real deal. Medicinal Oasis does an amazing job with this strain, and they've also crossed it with another strain to create an indica based strain called Pineapple Chunk as well. ",4,pineapple-express

Showlet,"Ok, where do I start... First of all the smell of this strain is incredible. Whenever you crush your buds before smoking it you gotta take that big sniff on your fingers because it smells so incredible. Then, the high is kinda sneaky. Starts off with the colors, then enters the buzz. The high is very &quot;Organic&quot;. You are never like &quot;oh i wish i was higher&quot; cause it always gets you good and high. Definetly one of my favorite strains!",5,pineapple-express
jeahisaidit,"This strain has the SHH - sleepy, happy, hungry that every good medicine should have. Pain melts away, worries fade into a background of general bliss. MS sufferers will appreciate the tasty treat along with it's potent pain numbing and mentally uplifting effects. If there was one thing  I had an issue with was the amount of time Pineapple Express gives you the dopest dope you'll ever toke's mighty effects, lasted about an hour to an hour and a half, with the comedown leading to a gentle introduction to sleep. Woke up feeling good with this strain, highly recommended.",4,pineapple-express
SeattleMetro,"Excellent for Social Anxiety, and related emotional and physiological issues. Great Taste; slightly pineapple as one would expect. Its not a &quot;Fat Bud&quot; type, so new smokers may think its buds are thin. That is the natural growth of Pineapple Express flower buds; no worries.",4,pineapple-express
Luke4,"This high is definitely hit or miss. While 90% of the times I have had this strain (which is quite a few) I have had an amazing head high in which I felt creative and open minded, the other 10% was an extremely over powering body high. I felt like I had absolutely no control over the energies in my body. Overall I woul HIGHly recommend this strain and I look forward to medicating with more.   ",4,pineapple-express
curtisw7,"So, appearance wise it looked very nice. Big nugs that were very dense! Nice white and amber triches all over. I was expecting a MUCH more pronounced smell. Definitely a sweet, fruity smell; not overwhelming. NOT nearly as potent smelling as the last oz of Killer Queen I picked up. I was worried that it wasn't going to be all that &quot;dank&quot; because the smell didn't knock me over.    I shouldn't have worried! This stuff hit hard! Great mild, fruity taste; great heady high that hits pretty quick. I felt it in my legs first and then immediately in my head. Pineapple Express is a Sativa dominant hybrid and you can definitely tell! It was 11pm and I wanted to go work on something! I was very motivated and stimulated. Might not be the best for bedtime.    Overall, I really enjoy this stuff! I've used it a few times today at work and have been very focused and productive! It's MUCH more potent than I expected! Normally when I vape, it will take a good 6-8 GOOD rips before I get where I like to be. With this stuff...four hits and I was LOVING LIFE! The most pronounced effect is an overwhelming sense of HAPPY!    Only real negatives are dry mouth/dry eyes (although the cotton-mouth wasn't as bad as a lot of good dank I've had). I can see where someone could use too much of this stuff too fast and feel a little &quot;tweeked.&quot; Don't do that.",4,pineapple-express

henryy235,"After trying a plethora of strains over the past year, I'd probably say this is the best one I've had so far.  Bought at a dispensary in Vancouver, WA.  Really good for daytime use, not quite as good for the night.  Good amount of THC, first use will likely have you high for a while.  Decent for appetite although probably not a first choice for it.  Overall a good strain for feeling really happy and good about whatever's happening in life.",5,pineapple-express
HerbalCarnival,"I love this strain! Pineapple Express is probably my favorite strain. Every time I smoke it I get so so high. The smell is sweet and tropical with a prominent pineapple smell, but the high is far sweeter. It'll start you off feelin a little wacky and hazy, then the euphoria hits you hard and you'll most likely get the gigs. This strain has a tendency to make me very horny so that may be an effect it has on you as well, which can be a nice effect too. I would say this strain is pretty much a 50/50 balance between Sativa and indica and they are both very noticeable. This stuff will have you in a trance where you feel like gleeful glob of butter Layin on your bed. The high will last you at least 4 hours and the effects will probably last at least 8, the head high is what is most dominant in the first couple hours and the body high slowly creeps in and becomes more and more overwhelming and you may end up falling asleep after a few hours. 5/5 strain, would definitely recommend. This stuff makes you so so happy far happier than most strains I've tried, which is a lot of strains. Stay medicated!",5,pineapple-express
alexjowkar1,"This is def my favorite strain right now.  Buds were nice and fluffy and coated with fur.  Smells great.  Leaves me talkative and happy.  Some strains leave me feeling kinda spacy when I come down, not this one.  A perfect high for going to work and dealing with nagging customers for 6 hours.",4,pineapple-express
Brothergrimmy,"I'm actually struggling for words right now. I smoke almost daily (for the last 2 years), so my tolerance has gotten a pretty up there. Mainly used for anxiety, insomnia, and PTSD.   I went to the dispensary on June 3rd, after finding out a friend had died -yay for recreational dispensaries- so I went in and saw they had it on the menu as a pre-roll. So I got it.  &quot;Dopest dope I've ever smoked&quot; doesnt even come close to giving this justice. I have never felt happier in my life. I was orbiting goddamn Jupiter. It was like heaven, it almost made me start believing in God again. The next time I see this... I'm buying as much as im legally allowed. This is, by a VERY long shot, the #1-#40 best I've had. Yes. It takes all 40 spots.  Long story short, it made one of the shittiest days... into one of the most carefree days. 100/100",5,pineapple-express
Heffay23,"If you donâ€™t play around with Pex(Pineapple Express) before you leave this earth have mercy on your soul! The is the stuff man let me tell you concerts, Christmas parties, awkward family get togethers. This strain can fix them all and more I love this strain have it in a timeless vape cart. The flavor is amazing kinda like a fruity pineapple banana flavor. Itâ€™s super cozy and you feel just happy you know. ",5,pineapple-express
dwrineha,"Tried as a Liquid Live Resin cart from Cresco Labs. I am a PTSD patient and generally use indica dominant varieties but this took MEDICATING on another level . If you want to legitimately feel â€œnormalâ€ù and battle anxiety, depression and lack of appetite. Very clean and clear feel that makes everything just seem right in the world. I was focused, euphoric, positive, extremely outgoing with a light grin. Starts off a bit stimulating and lays in behind the eyes. Very gentle comedown with very little notice in transitioning back to a calm and relaxed state. For me this acts better than a benzo for anxiety and significantly enhanced anti depressant quality boosting my Paxil big time",5,pineapple-express
Cerebral_Rush,"Pineapple Express is a strain every cultured smoker should look for in their collection. Popularized by the 2008 movie by the same name, Pineapple Express is a dominant Sativa hybrid that will provide you with a tropical blast while you toke. Pineapple Express offers a strong body buzz that is great for both Sativa and Indica lovers alike. Neither causing you strong paranoia or glueing you to the couch like many other potent Sativas and Indicas. While not sweet, the buds contain a strong citrus scent similar to other tropical themed strains. A hint of pineapple can be expected when inhaled. Pineapple Express is great for treating anxiety, stress, and even some forms of serious depression. If you are looking for a social strain or something to ease the stresses of everyday life Pineapple Express is a great addition to anyone's collection. It's amazing Sativa effects will leave you energized and relaxed allowing an individual to take full advantage of the strains medicinal and social properties. ",5,pineapple-express

UDtheAesir,"Hoo boy! This is one helluva strain! Really strong-smelling but surprisingly real good from a bong.  At first, it felt like nothing happened from the outset, so about 10 minutes later, the high sets in and just builds up. This is a really speedy high of sorts. It makes your mind race so fast your short-term memory takes a serious wallop compared to the other strains (from what I've experienced so far). But it makes you talkative as it wants you to talk about what you're feeling from the high. It's a very positive high, a very expressive high. This, my friends, is one of the best sativas out there.  Apart from the typical dry mouth, I'd definitely toke this again!",5,pineapple-express
Srcsm420,"I've been a smoker for a long time now and have kinda grown &quot;numb&quot; to it during the years.. I mean, I enjoy it, but rarely do I get the same buzz I did &quot;back in the day&quot; around 10 years ago. Never seem to get that paranoid, euphoric, giggly or have any chance of &quot;overdosing&quot; and getting dizzy or nauseous.   But now that I got some hydro-grown pineapple express, it instantly reminded me of those first fine quality buds I had... I only had smoked 2 bases from a bong and it felt like I had smoked 6-8 one hit bases.. A third one and called it quits..   Went back to my couch and heard a plane from outside... For some reason, I got really paranoid for just a few minutes. It sounded like a damn bomber or a jet and I kept looking around the sky from the edge of my window.... And that's when I started laughing, when I realized how paranoid I was.  Sat down on the couch, got comfortable and had one of the best highs I've had in years. Everything felt better, everything was beautiful, everything was alright.   Highly recommended! Feel-good weed :)",5,pineapple-express
Williamsson,Still loving this strain. A best of on my hybrid sativa list! Everything about Pineapple Express I love the sweet Mango-to-apple smell and the wonderful taste smoking it a piney sweet fruit taste.

CaliMamaPNW,"I have pretty severe anxiety and depression; Iâ€™m currently treating my anxiety with Zoloft, and while it works well for that, it honestly doesnâ€™t do much for my depression. I started my cannabis journey with CBD, hoping to help with my PMDD, and fell down a rabbit hole. Ringoâ€™s Gift, Sour Tsunami, and Remedy were godsends. I eventually decided to venture further into higher THC strains, but had a really hard time finding one that didnâ€™t send my anxiety off on a rocket. One day, while in a dispensary that isnâ€™t my usual, I saw Pineapple Express for $2 a gram. I remembered reading about it being really great for depression, so I decided to give it a shot.  I am SO glad I did.  When I vape it (I use an Atmos Jump), it is like a moderate sedative. My eyes get heavy, my face relaxes, and the part of my brain that is forever thinking negative thoughts just chills the fuck out and lets me enjoy things. I get negligible to no anxiety. My mood just completely changes. I can sleep, but I can also start a task and complete it (which is extra awesome because I also have ADD and it can make life miserable). I sometimes use it throughout the day (when I know I wonâ€™t be driving) and Iâ€™m able to stay calmly productive, and pretty much take things in stride. I feel so NORMAL. Except, you know, high lol. In my opinion, itâ€™s a very healing strain.  If youâ€™re like me and you struggle to find effective medication to treat your depression, absolutely give this a try. Itâ€™s beautiful :)",5,pineapple-express
AnonymousPanda,"WORKS SOOOO WELL FOR ANXIETY! As someone who suffers from panic attacks this strain is PERFECT for those who need to stay awake and not feel sleepy, but who usually get anxious from sativaâ€™s.   Made popular by the movie, I actually think this strain is underestimated for itâ€™s uplifting, euphoric, and aphrodisiac effects. Great to smoke before going out with friends to ease anxiety, hours before bed during wind-down time (watching tv, reading, etc.), or for anything you feel you may need a calm mind and a motivational boost for.   I smoked a large j about 15 min ago and am a photographer and stoked to edit some photos right now before going to bed. It also eased my anxious mind that was running all over the place. All of a sudden, I found my heart rate slowed and I had a smile on my face.  Great for day use and evening use as well. Highly recommended ",5,pineapple-express

I was even able to go to an event where I stood and danced for 6 hours straight because of this strain. That's something I haven't been able to do for years!

GardeningAtNight,"Where to begin..... This is a legendary strain! So much has already been said about Pineapple Express. I was lucky enough to finally try this strain recently, and I must say, my expectations were sky high- mainly due to claims like â€œHands down the dopest dope Iâ€™ve ever smoked.â€ù  Aroma- To me, Pineapple Express has a floral/fruity smell. The name itself makes a lot of sense, and given this strains origins(Hawaiian/Trainwreck), I figured it would smell tropical. I wouldnâ€™t say Pineapple is specifically apparent in the smell, but it definitely has a sweet smell.  Taste- Sweet and Tropical. Truly great. The flavor is much more general than pineapple, as hints of citrus and other tropical fruits are present in my experience.  Effects- With my few experiences, the best way to describe the effects is that it is a mood booster. I didnâ€™t feel very energized after smoking it like I saw some people suggest, but it didnâ€™t make me tired either. The high itself is well balanced. Not overly euphoric but enough to be satisfied. I had a fairly clear mind, and was able to hold conversations fine. Pineapple Express seems to be a versatile experience, as it can help you unwind without feeling very tired.   Overall, Pineapple Express has a fantastic taste and aroma, while leaving you with a solid, well balanced high. I canâ€™t say â€œItâ€™s the dopest dope Iâ€™ve ever smokedâ€ù, but I was nonetheless pleased with my experiences. ",5,pineapple-express

Hempnesi,"Pineapple Express from Cresco Labs is available in PA and is an instant favorite for me. This strain boasts the high levels of terpinolene (citrus, gassy, tropical, sweet) I'm always after. The flower, CO2 &amp; Liquid Live Resin products are phenomenal and consistent across board with each batch and over the products available with this strain.   Regardless of the grower, and the processors, this strain is easily recognizable. It will hit you fast at any potency but the initial intensity will not last too long, so don't worry if you feel it quite a bit and have somewhere to be. It will accumulate in your sinuses and may be slightly harsh or tickle the throat if you prefer more floral and softer flavors. It will relax you and give you that dry, soft comfortable feeling with growing, lasting flavors behind your nose and on your taste buds after you put it down. Great for relaxing the body a little bit, resolving away muscle pain and soreness but will allow your mind and creativity to flow.   This strain will melt away stressful thoughts and anxiety and leave you happy and open to socializing. Enjoy!",5,pineapple-express

thatonehxckid,"I'm not even sure if I should review this yet, because it's still so early into the high, but I decided to keep a journal of my experience, so here it goes:    8:00pm:    This stuff is pretty dang good. It was only $28/8th and with all the hype, I just HAD to pick it up. I keep hearing in these reviews how happy it makes everyone, and I guess that is a pretty good word for it. Smoked one bowl, got 4 decent-sized hits off of it, you know, where you don't really PUSH yourself, you just inhale til you feel full!    I definitely have a head buzz with that lovely pressure feeling in your sinuses (the good kind, not the bad!). A small body buzz, nothing crazy, just the enhanced sensitivity to touch that I get from almost all strains.     8:45pm:    Just got back from the store, had some major munchies so my girlfriend and I are cooking up a pizza and some garlic bread. Buzz is starting to come down sadly, but I'm still technically high. Stuff is still funnier, my concentration is still a bit lacking, and I still have some awful munchies and some cottonmouth. Still happier than normal, but not quite the uncontrollable ecstaticness that I had at first, leaves me wanting to smoke more to keep it back up until I decide to wind down for bed. Any body buzz/heady feeling is pretty much gone.    All in all, a pretty good strain I'd say. Worth picking up if you can find some that's at a good price, or some that's REALLY crystally and well-grown to it's maximum potential.",3,pineapple-express

SmileHighFL,By far favorite for depression... I cant say how much this has kicked my depression in the face and I was in the deep in without floaties or a joint !,5,pineapple-express
Codyloc915,This is my favorite strand and not because of the movie... I found this to be one of the very few stains that help with pain and sleep. The taste of this flower is delightful and anyway you smoke it you have the same effects. I have arthritis and this just makes it go away which helps put me to sleep. This strain also calms nerves and relaxes you to sleep without tossing and turning throughout the night. I highly highly recommend this strand although itâ€™s so hard to find in Albuquerque. ,5,pineapple-express
Tiki_Kreeper17,"â€œThe Good Stuffâ€ù  I canâ€™t say enough about this wonderful strain. Smells delicious,tastes great and not too much of a sativa kick (for me) at all which is good as I usually prefer less of a cerebral high. This will have me fully relaxed,mind at ease and and pain free for the most part.   I tattoo for a living and have pretty bad carpal in both hands. This strain allows me to tattoo long sessions with zero hand fatigue or pain while keeping my head on straight and in the zone. This strain is my money maker,no coils shall ever make my hands fall victim to pain ever again!!! ",5,pineapple-express
Gcab,"i don't think I've ever tried a better strain than this one! The best for me. Gives you a happy, light, relaxed high. _Ÿ‘Œ_Ÿè_",5,pineapple-express
AnxiousBudz,"I give this three stars because this strain got me high as a kite. I suffer from anxiety and depression and PTSD. This strain made my anxiety 10 times worse. I literally couldnâ€™t feel my feet touching the ground. Lasted for about an hour of high anxiety and than a slow motion giggly phase came on. I fell asleep playing Xbox and didnâ€™t wake up until the next morning. Good strain for someone who likes the cerebral effect. For those of us who suffer from panic, stick with Indicas.

40thStreetBlack,Stuff made me energetic but the 2nd pull gave me bad paranoia... I ended laying in a bathtub and listening to soft music until the feeling left... kinda disappointed,2,pineapple-express
VapeQueen710,"Method: Opus Xtracts Pineapple Express Cartridge (85.9% THC)  Aroma: Smelled like some sweet cannabis. 1/1 Star.  Taste: Definitely closer to the flower in a joint than most vape companies truly go but I'm a terp girl so a little more pineapple kick would be cool. Very natural taste just like they promised. 1.5/2 Star.  Feel: One sneaky mf. We laughed at the absurdity of pants. The idea of them and that if you used a sewing machine on some fabric twice you could make some of the fanciest $600 pairs with practice. I felt like I was moving slowly but really enjoyed moving. Make sure you're all set for bed before you do this because you'll be fucking fried. It can get visual and almost psychedelic on higher doses. After my childhood friend and I said goodnight and I got in bed I felt like I was melting like butter on a steak. My mouth was so freaking dry and my eye were bloodshot too. It was a treat but one puff set me down good, a little too good for a daily strain. Not a functional high but enjoyable. Didn't make me hungry but great for some treat yo self dining. 1.75/2 Stars.  Ranking: I was visiting a friend not in the Bay Area and I'm gonna need us to catch up because this 85% THC actually knocked me on my butt in a good way. Good antidepressant. This some Burning Man weed. All aboard!  Total: 4.25/5 Stars.",4,pineapple-express

igler312,"My favorite strain. Fucks me good. I feel like so happy. Even when I smoke it with this high tolerance. I have anxiety and it makes me so happy it doesnâ€™t trigger panic attacks though Iâ€™d say itâ€™s heavier on the sativa side for a hybrid. Maybe itâ€™s just me, but maybe itâ€™ll be someone elseâ€™s favorite too",5,pineapple-express

octosquid,"I've been exploring different strains for quite some time and Pineapple Express is by far my favourite. Only time trying it was from vaping. Interesting to see how it would differ from smoking the bud.  I generally get intense reactions from weed like increased heart rate, really inhibited sense of perception where I can't understand sounds or words or anything around me, and even slightly hallucinate.  But from Pineapple Express, it was easily one of the best highs I've had. I had been exploring strains for so long trying to pay attention to what does and doesn't work with me, and it's so relieving to say that this is one of them that does work well with me!",5,pineapple-express
Mama2many44,Itâ€™s a very big upper helps me get an appetite which I pack big time. Helps my depression and pain levels and anxiety and boosts my libido. Side effect is crazy dry mouth and can make u feel hyper sometimes.. made me feel floaty first time I smoked it.,5,pineapple-express

Stevieg59,"Sorry, but after some further experimentation, must amend my recent review of Pineapple Express and downgrade to 4.0.  &quot;Points off&quot; for hangover and length of high.  Otherwise, strong and interesting 60/40 sativa dominant, CBDA 1.04%, THC 0.67, THCA 22.65% (TOTAL 24.36%)!  Still, Dynamte on my scale (but not Moby Tripper).  I am more of a &quot;sativa guy&quot; and go for long energy and clean finishes.  Best hybird more like Golden Goat (which has lower THC etc. but)... way more uplifting and euphoric ... and is no slouch bodywise.  So, it's a matter of taste and application.",4,pineapple-express
DreamDrop,"Overall a great strain. I have bipolar II and this really helps even me out, especially when I'm depressed. I felt like this strain made me really euphoric and introspective at the same time. It wasn't great for socializing but it was a life saver during a panic attack. I personally prefer indica strains- something that's more relaxing and great for hanging with buds (pun intended). Every once and a while I'd feel the slightest bit nauseous after smoking it, but the feeling went away pretty fast.",4,pineapple-express
jordanmullins84,"Literally... the best strain to smoke a pipe sesh with and pass the heck out in 10-15 minutes!! if you smoke bong rips, high lasts bout every 30 min and have to take a hoot every time so you won't sleep..only down side.

Not in a big rush for anything, just wanna take my time. I do feel slightly ... Fidigity. But it's not too big a deal. I am currently sick right now, with a horrible sore throat, and I do not feel any pain at all right now.

venvalle,"I tried this strain in a Select Elite cartridge.  It makes me feel uplifted for sure. There is a numbing feeling that hits immediately throughtout my whole body, and I get a rush of energy. My neck pain fades and I feel much better, generally okay with life. It's nice for a daytime high, but I recently have been smoking it less and less, as it makes me so spacey. I forget what I'm saying halfway through a sentence, I forget why I walked into a room, sometimes I just forget what I am doing immediately after I set out to do it. It makes it difficult to use in social sitiations because I just can't keep up with conversations. I feel so dumb when I smoke this!

Iâ€™ve loaded up my one hitter which holds approx 12mg, took 1 hit and got through about a third of it.  3 minutes later and Iâ€™m writing this and whatever else Iâ€™m trying to think about and 10 mins after.  Soooooooo.  Yeah Iâ€™m pretty f**king high right now.   The edges of my eyes feel like the vision has invisible bumpers on them. Now and then I get rainbow strobes going down them instead.   I guess that counts as pretty f**king high.  I feel light headed, calm, relaxed and also Iâ€™m sure I would have the energy to do something if I could think what to do.  Oh yeah feed the cats.  Hello again.  I feel good. I nearly laughed at thinking about laughing so you can get the idea of this. My head does feel pressure on my forehead but I canâ€™t decide if itâ€™s nice or not haha.  Right Iâ€™m ending this here. It feels good, Iâ€™ve no complaints.    4 stars!   My only thing is that the peak peaks quick and then itâ€™s a mellow come down which makes me feel like I have to smoke more which isnâ€™t bad but not what I want.  ",4,pineapple-express

As someone who suffers from panic disorders, I always wanted to try this strain but thought it may have too much of a paranoia factor for me. I saw how pretty this batch of buds was at my local dispensary and was talked into trying it by a bud-tender there.   Iâ€™m so glad I tried it! Although I donâ€™t use it super often, itâ€™s such a good strain when I want to clean or just have that extra boost of energy and euphoria that makes my day just a little better. Itâ€™s a good one to smoke in the morning or the early afternoon, I love how it tastes the most!   I rate this classic strain 4.2/5 overall, flavor is a 4.5/5 for me and the appearance is a 4/5.

I prefer the vape to flower on a daily basis because I can have some during work and not be out of it. In fact, this strain(and strawberry cough) are my go toâ€™s on a work day. (Vaping)   The flower is good on a day that Iâ€™m home because it does feel strong to me (but makes me enjoy music a lot!) I also like having PEX and then playing drums. So good.

UnexpectedStoner,"Who knew itâ€™d live up to the clichÃ©? For me, this is the ideal strain. Happiness, euphoria, and relaxation are all very present while also providing a low-key energy. Doesnâ€™t make me tired or lazy at all. Most unexpected is the fact that it does not give me the munchies, a first for me. Deserves all 5 stars for sure.

Nik_Nak,"Iâ€™m not a big fan of sativa because Iâ€™m pretty sensitive to just about any kind of medicine. I go through all the reviews or most of them before I try a new bud and Iâ€™m usually grouped in with that ONE person who said they got paranoid with it or something weird. Thatâ€™s me, Iâ€™m that sensitive. It gave me restless legs, a little anxiety, and kept me up ALL night. I smoked it @8p (not a good idea).  With that being said, the high was great!! The bud smells sweet and the smoke doesnâ€™t burn. Itâ€™s a very light and fluffy weed, sticky and a little hard to break apart with your fingers. Donâ€™t let the softness of the high fool you because this stuff lasts for hours; I didnâ€™t smoke much, maybe a small bowl of it, and the high itself lasted over 4 hours. It came on a little slow and steady and smooth, a delicious cerebral high. Very VERY creative, really had my musical juices flowing. I was making music in my head, adding in instruments one at a time and hearing each layer as theyâ€™re being added in my mind, hearing the beautiful bass, it was amazing. I would have to say thatâ€™s the most creative Iâ€™ve felt in that capacity with any other bud.   Pretty sure it made me horny, too, but I had also smoked some blueberry a couple hours later when I was trying to get my body to wind down, so that couldâ€™ve been it too.   I am going to try this for a wake and bake. Itâ€™s a light enough sativa where youâ€™ll feel some energy but not too hyper (unless you smoke more than Iâ€™d did youâ€™ll probably feel like you took a mild energy drink). Itâ€™ll relax you as well. Itâ€™s a great happy, hopeful, creative, letâ€™s get into some fun shit, bud. Perfect sativa strain!  Enjoy!  ",3,pineapple-express

Intense fruity, woodsy, slight spice aromas. A bit dry, but not bad...broke up pretty good. Smoke was smooth, yet expanding and the flavor on the exhale very fruity. Pineappley? Maybe more tropical. Definitely a good smoke. ... left me feeling all over good. My PTSD symptoms were relieved and I was able to continue on with my day. The hybrid effect is definitely there, the heady sativa high giggle munchies etc and the body and mind relaxation of the indica balanced very well.

I bought some Banjo and wanted to calm myself down with it (since it makes me kinda act in patterns) but my head starts saying â€œhey give it more time, its not done yet! Keep waking around and jotting ideas on your whiteboard that you hung up on your wallâ€ù so here i am thinking about Banjo but respecting Pineapple Express and itâ€™s army of supportive terpenes heheh",5,pineapple-express
MyJokerHandStayLIT,Pineapple Express - A nice yet dark shatter a bit sticky more like a snap and the pull. I feel a euphoria and a cloud â˜Åï¸è lifting me up. I feel my mood relax my mind get happier and overall I have a _Ÿ˜_ all around.  I feel great. Definitely gives you some mental energy which is really nice especially when youâ€™re not feeling too well. This would absolutely be a phenomenal stranger anytime during the day if you need to get something done while also being medicated. But would also be good in the evenings if you would like to do anything or just be more euphoric and energy to do something. I enjoy the mental shift the most and the body relaxation slightly behind. I would absolutely buy again. Would love a sugar form. A Happy strain for sure.  NOT SPECIFIC FOR ANXIETY BUT DOES HELP A GOOD BIT ,5,pineapple-express

Kattmint,"Out of all that I've tried so far, Pineapple Express makes me the most euphoric and I can't say I've ever had a bad day after using this nice daytime strain. I've also found that it's a champ at relieving premenstrual cramping! Overall, it's one of the most enjoyable highs a strain has given me most of the time, but I find it has the capacity to make a little paranoid too and more often than I'd like- moreso than other strains, so I'll leave it at four stars from me.",4,pineapple-express
macekushdu,"Big fan of the movie, personally I always wanted to get my hands on this strain. With my most recent Las Vegas Trip still here as of 12/14/18. I picked this strain up at Las Vegas Releaf (paradise location). Grabbed a 3.5g of this for $39, with taxes added of course. Aromas of Pineapple with Citrusy Piney undertones, breaks down so easily while you break the buds down. Pretty High THC %. The high overall is amazing, you can never overmedicate with this strain, great stress reliever and for anxiety also, gets those creative juices flowing type of strains. ",5,pineapple-express

DorrieFL58,"My favorite strain, at the moment. I vape the oil and it has been a godsend to me. Almost immediately after vaping it, my pain is gone, my anxiety and depression. I have to be careful about how long a draw I take because it can kick my ass pretty hard sometimes. It gives me energy to get up and do things, and if I smoke it, before bed, I sleep like a baby.

I have major depressive disorder and this literally felt like getting drunk in the sense that it was a downer for me. It made me think about everything wrong and made me even more depressed. I also used it for light pain multiple times and it didn't do anything for that either. What a boring high I got from this. Even though this has all the hype and sex appeal by smelling good, looking good, and having a movie named after it, it didn't do what I needed it to. Plus this left me in a haze to where I felt foggy. Much like when you drink too much alcohol and start getting drunk and are near that &quot;I'm about to pass out&quot; point.",1,pineapple-express

LeafPsi,"Personally, I found this to be a weak strain. I've held off on this review for about a year because I wasn't sure if I was just not getting the most optimal use out of Pineapple Express but I've come to find that this one just isn't for me but could be for others.  For me this is a bubbly high; it's like the light beer of the liquor world and that it takes a very large amount of it to get me feeling anything 'worthwhile'. However, Pineapple Express being a hybrid I do have to praise it for being precisely in the middle of that spectrum. The balance struck is perfect should one be looking for an afternoon delight as it should leave you in above moderate condition.  Having the pleasure of enjoyed this through flower and vape carts I can firmly say that the flavor is incredibly tropically fruity. I'd argue a more banana taste over a pineapple one but it doesn't detract from the enjoyment.  Tl;dr: A fine strain for a beginner or average user to get them through a light afternoon. Uplifting, subtle head high, and a soothing relaxation with a fruity hit to the taste buds. Not for me, but might be for you!",3,pineapple-express
beautybychandra,"Glorious - â€œDopest dope I ever smoked.â€ù It has the best flavor! Awesome feeling mentally and physically.

Mystic97,"_Ÿçç_Ÿ_© Best of the Best _Ÿ_©_Ÿçç Hands down the best weed I've ever smoked, and will ever be. So strong, I only need one puff to get to the euphoria land. At a low dose it takes all your anxieties away, and leaves you in a really good state. Perfect for morning or night use. It smells like pine and tastes like smoked pineapple, and sometimes minty. It never disappoints. _Ÿ’¨_Ÿ‘Œ",5,pineapple-express
alydenneane813,"This strain I first tried in Colorado to help treat my very aggressive depression. It helped in so many ways possible. I hated taking pills to try to curve this depression rotting in me, but it was never enough. I was recommended this strain by a friend and it made me feel amazing. I felt happy, and alive for for the first time in years. my moods changed I was happy, because I was happy, actually happy. It helped me sleep better, and my appetite greatly increased. Although I did have to be home or someone I felt safe to smoke this certain strain, for the realn that it made me feel a tad bit paranoid as weird as that sounds, but other then that it has a A++.",5,pineapple-express
fallingslowly9,The current strain im reviewing is from an outdoor grow so my experience may be slightly different in terms of appearance. Very resiny and fluffy buds.  (I have tried it a from an indoor grow a few years ago). both gave me the same effects. I felt very very very happy and thoughtful. Smells like straight up tropical fruit. great strain. ,5,pineapple-express
younggrasshopper,really good bud a nice light shade of green that smells like gods vagina as my friend put it. as soon as you open the bag the smell hits you and its wonderful. it taste amazing also. it isnt anything insane like its portrayed in the movie pineapple express but its up there itsa  nice strand of bud.  ,4,pineapple-express

Literally unusual things pop up in your mind, and it is funny, and it is the way it made me happy. I felt like living in a sci-fic movie without the threat of danger.  this is one of the strains that really made me want to laugh/smile in the public out of nowhere.  not the best of best strain but definitely had some unforgettable experience with it.",4,pineapple-express

,Tw (Trainwreck) Reviews ,,
StukaFox,"Chugga-chugga-choo-chooAWFUCK! ho-LY shit -- it's a TRAINWRECK! You'd think a strain named Trainwreck would leave your broken body sprawled out by the tracks while confused NTSB investigators poked at your corpse, but not this stuff: this Trainwreck wants to kill you with kindness. And it is SO kind. We're talking Uncle John's Band kind. From the first limey hit, Trainwreck wraps its arms around you like your old Nana and whispers that everything is going to be ok. Then it leaves you alone for a couple of minutes before sneaking up and lifting you gently to cruising altitude. From there, it's like being seated on the world's most comfortable couch at 20,000 feet -- for about two hours. The high won't leave you glued to your chair, nor will it make you get up and dance: this is sitting by the river listening to Tame Impala with your friends kinda weed. This is good times, big smiles and warm days. This is dancing to the Dead and getting a hug from a pretty girl (or boy -- whatever your wont!). Why they called this stuff Trainwreck is beyond me; I guess &quot;Just Good Cannabis&quot; didn't have the same impact. Maybe &quot;Thomas the Dank Engine&quot;? Shit, that's already taken. Anyway, smoke some of this shit and you'll feel good. The end.",5,trainwreck
leobud,"I am 41, and someone who smokes regularly (several times a day) &amp; this is my favorite flower. It TRULY helps w/ chronic pain, &amp; helps your mentality. I have a rare disease that makes me hafta take lots o meds (Oxycontin, Oxycodone, Diladid, &amp; various muscle relaxers) &amp; am confined (when I go out) to a wheel chair. This stuff not only is a great, &quot;break-through&quot; pain reliever, when all my pain meds fail me, but also helps lift my spirits better than any other flower I've tried (and thats ALOT, LOL!) and also settles me down when I need to go out in public (all the meds make me &quot;trippy&quot;). Hope this helps someone to at least give it a try. :)",5,trainwreck
GooglyDancingBear,"Trainwreck welcomed me back to the world of marijuana! I had &quot;party smoked&quot; junior high school through college until the mid-90's when I graduated and got jobs that randomly drug tested....government jobs...I am watching you. LOL. Just local small town Planning and Community Development jobs. Up to the point I quit smoking for employment reasons, I smoked whatever came to me. Sometimes good, sometimes bleck. Never bothered with strain info. Now, fast forward to the mid-00's and my eventual defeat by my lifelong chronic depression. When I say defeat, I mean government disability due to &quot;chronic non-medical responsive depression&quot;. Basically, I lost my wife at 36yrs old and couldn't function enough to hold a job and was failing to help my son through his grief. The loss of anything keeping me ok fell apart. I even allowed myself to do shock treatment to kick my depression. Didn't work. Only humilitation from the stigma. Suicide was always lurking in the shadows....THEN....my sister had some weed 2 xmas' ago and couldn't fly with it so I decided to get high after all this time. Trainwreck was it's name and it gave me a fighting chance to push the depression to at least arms length. I had no idea you could breed specific strains to help with specific ailments. It gave me that needed space to shake free from my depression and actually say &quot;I'm ok.&quot; I cried and cried and cried. I had finally found the thing that could help me in my fights with depression. I am in a non-medical state and have to search real hard to get Trainwreck or a similar sativa dominant hybrid that helps the most. But I won't let that stop me.  Thank you Trainwreck. You'll never know how much you helped me change my life.",5,trainwreck
tommywiseau,"A friend and I smoked this recently and I can say that it's been one of my greatest highs to date. It burns quickly and well compared to most, and got us feeling good within a small amount of time. This strain made me feel very euphoric; everything felt great and there was a considerable distortion of time with this one. Though the high lasts a long time, it wore down after awhile and I became sleepy quite quickly. Recommended for insomniacs or anyone who wants a euphoric high.",4,trainwreck
thomash7676,This strain is great. I'm 10 puffs in and I'm already feeling it. I love this strain because it's a great alternative if you have ADD /ADHD and you take Adderall or any other stimulant for that you should try this. I've been taking adderall since I was in2nd grade (I'm in college btw) and this is much nicer than taking a stimulant. Work and class fly by and This strain makes me very calm and collective. This is just something you should smoke to have fun as an everyday thing to improve work or school. I hope this review was helpful. ,5,trainwreck
Squatchmo,"With a taste almost like dusty pine needles and aromatics reminiscent of a skunk den in an old pine stump, the Trainwreck high comes like a thief in the night and hits like a sledgehammer to the head. I felt my face getting intoxicated mere seconds after my first hit and I've got a wonderful sativa-y headspace minutes after my smoke session. This strain absolutely cuts down depression and stress while providing the energy and motivation to go out and do something/get things done.  The buds are a healthy shade of light green and look like they just came out of Siberia due to the overwhelming amount of trichomes. Trainwreck has always been one of my favorites and is highly recommended for socializing, parties, or outdoor recreation (motherfucking hiking this summer yo)",5,trainwreck

spacejunkOG,"Trainwreck has almost mythical genetic origins, and a few different accounts of where &amp; when the strain was first bred.  In recent years this previously &quot;clone-only&quot; strain was purchased by Greenhouse Seeds, and provided in seed form on the open market globally.  Many people argue that the &quot;real&quot; strain, which supposedly originated in Arcata, California, is not what you get when you buy it from a seed company, and is *only* available in clone form via trusted growers' networks.  The seed company claims to have simply inbred the clone, to provide an exact replica of the original strain.  The flowering time on trainwreck is also hugely debated and even more shrouded in mystery - which adds to some very different batches of trainwreck - harvested on the late side, you can very easily be stuck on the couch with this stuff.  harvested on the early side with the right environmental factors you could be writing a Physio paper.  Regardless of which phenotype you get, I have never encountered or grown a version of Trainwreck that didn't have the distinctive SPICY, overpowering smell which to me is indicative of the South / Central American genetics that are prevalent in the strain and which I believe lend to its tall, lanky, very sativa-like leaf / branch structure (the flowers, on the other hand, tend to be ubiquitous clusters of relatively small popcorn buds, which are usually highly resinous and sparkling with glass-shard-sized trichomes by mid-flower).  This is also a GREAT medical strain.  Those with general anxiety and eye pressure or eye fatigue should feel amazing relief of ocular pressure and a sense of muscular relaxation without sedation.",5,trainwreck
casparproject,"Headstash makes a damn fine shatter out of this girl.  I could taste the soil she was grown in, smelled the air she breathed.  Only thing I couldn't taste was the sunlight she bathed in, but I have no freaking clue what that tastes like (I dunno, hot?), so whatevs.  Did I mention that this stuff will wreck you?  Seriously, son.  Damn.",5,trainwreck
heidijohnsonn,"There's a reason why it's called train wreck, because this strain literally hits you like a train! I can go from sober straight to bring high as fuck! It just comes out of no where. &amp; it doesn't take much either. It has a VERY strong smell, my mom could smell it as soon as she got in my car while it was in a closed container. It gives you more of an up, happy feeling rather than being tired. I highly recommend this strain! ",5,trainwreck
Weedsprin,"Trainwreck is seriously a strain that could change your perspective and ultimately change your entire life.  It's an uplifting strain with endless benefits.   I picked some of this up to use while running and could run for miles.  It helps with fatigue, depression, appetite -- just about everything ---   For those growers out there, this is one of the prettiest flowering plants in the world.  She is an easy strain to grow and yields thick sparkly colas with killer pistols.  Just about everyone could benefit from this strain --- If you haven't been on the train --- I would definitely buy an eighth and wreck it !",5,trainwreck
OGloc,"This did exactly what I thought it would, hit me like a train. I smoked this out of a 10&quot; bong and took a nice strong hit. I wasn't coughing as much as I thought I would but the high was nice and calm, I felt extremely euphoric and could tell it was strongly sativa dominant. Me and my friends watched Pineapple Express while smoking this diesely, sour, earthy strand. It's amazing and deserves 5 stars hands down. It didn't cause dry mouth like Sour OG does, but I had munchies like never before. ",5,trainwreck
moses5150,Its called Train Wreak fro a reason. After the first good hit your brain gets splattered into nothingness and your creativity goes through the roof. I figured out what came first with the chicken and the egg with this once upon a time. I also was able to pass trig while stoned. if your ever having issues with letting go or suffer from severe ADHD like I do then this is the best thing you can have. great for wake and bake but not so good for nighttime. gives you way vivid dreams. but makes getting things done through out the day way easier. give it a try but make sure it is a nor cal strain. ,5,trainwreck
Free2beme,this strain really works for my anxiety due to health issues and my PTSD . Plus I am able to get in to writing or painting coloring or whatever creative project I have going on . This strain is worth the price and will last a little longer well it's my experience. I give this 5stars.,5,trainwreck
docgrnthmb,"wow bro, I'm fucked off right now with this great choice of cannibis.  love the head high with the much needed bonus of the pain relief. awesome for my depressed thoughts, as it makes me very relaxed and open minded to what's goin on around me... as a Medicinal rather than the recreation user, I find this to be A+ on my chart as far as Hybrids go. very pleased ",5,trainwreck
CJ1660,"(Iâ€™m writing this review as I smoke this strain.) 1st hit of joint- The taste isnâ€™t too bad. Very lemony and it isnâ€™t too hard on your lungs if youâ€™re a regular smoker. 2nd hit of joint- Starting to feel that buzz. Iâ€™m not sure what to expect yet but I can already tell this is sativa because Iâ€™m ready to expect something. 3rd hit of joint- Iâ€™m so happy. 4th hit of joint- Iâ€™m already pretty high and I smoke almost daily.  5th hit of joint- Seems like itâ€™s burning super slow. I mean weâ€™re nearly at six thatâ€™s not bad. Weâ€™ll see though.  6th hit of joint- I just coughed really hard. Yeah thereâ€™s a bubble of air in my chest now, weâ€™re still burning guys.  7th hit of joint- Iâ€™m not going to lie. Iâ€™m pretty happy right now. Everything is just great. Music just sounds great! My dogs just seem great! This chair is just so great too. I just tried to write review number 8 but Iâ€™m still at 7 I think. Lost in thought. 8th hit of joint- And sheâ€™s out. Iâ€™m impressed.",5,trainwreck
Jonathan512,"The epitome of sativa-dominance! Fun, energetic and creative head high that's very functional. Perfect for social situations and wake and bakes. If you consume a lot you will notice the high shifts to a more balanced hybrid experience with increased pain relief, and intense euphoria. If well grown and cured this strain has amazing trichome coverage on light green buds, with a clean piney citrusy smell! Great clean flavor on the inhale and exhale.",4,trainwreck
Smoke206,"Trainwreck is one of my favorite strains so far. I wouldn't so much say that it hits you like a trainwreck, but it definitely does creep up on you after awhile. I'd say it takes 15/30 minutes before you realize you're high. Then, it only gets higher from there. I've found it hits me in stages. But, the feeling of relaxation starts about 15 minutes in. I feel it just wash over me in entirety, and it just makes me feel peaceful, happy, and relaxed. Perfect to come home to after a long or stressful day. For me, the smoke is quite smooth. I'm normally a cougher, as I have asthma, so I find smoking is pretty rough - not this. I'm able to take bigger, deeper hits, without coughing my brains out. I've noticed that it takes awhile to fully knock me out, aka get me to a sleep state. Probably within a couple hours? It does knock me out for a good 4 - 5 hours of sleep, where I'll be dead to the world. Haven't been able to sleep longer than that on it so far, regardless of how much I smoke of it. It doesn't make me super ravenously hungry, but I do crave certain foods about 45 minutes in. Something salty, or sweet usually. I normally smoke out of a water bong, filled with ice/cold water. My hubby and I have found that occasionally it can make you feel quite relaxed/frisky at times as well. :)",5,trainwreck
PunkRockBilly,"I picked this up a week or so ago, medicated with it once and then hid it from myself or I would have used it all up. The sample I had was 100% amazing. No pain, no stress, no nothing...just damned good times chatting with the wifey.",4,trainwreck

KrispyChickun,"My friend and I picked up about half a gram yesterday... Had us feeling very high after 1 or 2 hits... Made us cough a lot but it tasted really good. Had a super pungent smell...  I took almost 10 bong hits  and literally couldn't see straight or walk right. I got very relaxed, tripped out and happy. I had a redbull an hour later and it didn't even affect the high that much.

Total head high that makes you feel really happy (great for depression), but very couch-lockish. This is the perfect bud for watching a movie or just hangin with the boob tube. A little overwhelming the first 10-15 min of smoking (similar to headband) then it settles in nice. Little body euphoria but really a head high",4,trainwreck

Samckellips,This is my first review but Wow this is a great bud! I don't have my medical card but my brother does and he brought home some of this and wow I smoked it earlier today with him and I was sitting at a table and BAM! I was a trainwreck I smoke daily and I was SUPER high. Now tonight I sat in my beanbag love sack and loded a bowl and just had a great time just chillin with some music. Then I got up and forgot why. Very short term forgetfulness but I think I have fallen in love with this strain!,4,trainwreck
Kcidymccus,"There are hundreds upon thousand of weed strains out there. But this strain, this shits on a whole other fucking level. Whether u smoke it alone or mix it with a another strain youâ€™ll ALWAYS be wrapped in a blanket of euphoria. This strain is LIKE NO OTHER STRAIN! It doesnâ€™t make you FORGET all the bad things in your life. It makes you recognize them and be totally ok with it! You start to think â€œHey that bad shit thatâ€™s happening, fuck it, thats life manâ€ù. THIS IS WHAT BEING HIGH IS SUPPOSED TO FUCKING FEEL LIKE! Everything in life is better and different but life is so good, that you cNâ€™t even remember what its like when ur not high, it just feels like youâ€™ve always felt this way and you always will feel this way. You can also function with this strain! You might even find yourself being able to talk to people better or think clearer! Itâ€™s like god hand bred the strain himself!Also, I know a lot of people smoke to avoid alertness and sleep BUT this strain makes it so you can sleep if u want or stay awake if u choose. You feel so in control. So far Iâ€™ve had my bf and my friends all try it and they agreed its the best strain. Its god damn perfection. If you smoke enough, IT WILL FEEL LIKE YOUR FIRST TIME GETTING HIGH! Heavy weed smokers, occasional users, newbies, this shit doesnâ€™t discriminate against anyone man. (Note, I have been smoking Tropical Train wreck carts from supreme rather train wreck alone but from the other reviews Iâ€™ve been reading, Train wreck is outstanding on its own.)   *One more thing, if you smoke this shit RIGHT before you sleep, youâ€™ll get SUPER realistic dreams. Theyâ€™re not ALWAYS gold dreams but even when theyâ€™re bad the experience is so fucking dope and the dreams are never intense enough to the point where you canâ€™t sleep. ",5,trainwreck

bradk,"Trainwreck a strain that really self explains itself as it gets you feeling quite euphoric, as well as happy, relaxed and creative. It will awaken you and make you see things differently that's for sure. TW is a strain that should be used for people who suffer from depression, anxiety, add/adhd and PTSD, or for like an artist or someone with a creative mind, or if you want to get even more into to it it's also a great strain for anyone looking for a nice high that will keep you awake and active rather than couch locked.",5,trainwreck

paytonchar,"My absolute favorite. I picked up a small sample of this (only an eighth) one time from my dispensary to last me a day while I was on vacation and ever since then I search for this strain wherever I go. Seriously, I dream of this baby. The high was so functional, yet so strong. I honestly had one of the best days of my life, and all I did was sit at the beach with my friends! Every time I order the first question I ask is &quot;where's the trainwreck?&quot; I can see why my dispensary is always sold out of this bad boy. I would choose this amazing strain over any other in the galaxy, it's really THAT good! The chronic pain just faded away and all I could feel was happiness and rainbows inside. 100 percent reccomend, this sativa is the bomb!",5,trainwreck
skullerymaid,"So, the thing with Trainwreck is the effects can really vary between growers, and even batches. Sometimes it's couchlocky and sometimes it's not. IMO the &quot;true&quot; Trainwreck experience is a euphoric but clear headed high, eliminating all extraneous thoughts and desires and allows you to coexist blissfully in the present moment. Good batches of Trainwreck are absolutely perfect for anyone suffering depression, ptsd, anxiety and light pain. I recently picked up some Trainwreck because I had about 4 days of horrible anxiety and panic attacks. My chest and abdomen physically hurt from the prolonged stress. Two bowls of Trainwreck and i was finally, finally, omg finally relaxed and content. Spent an hour silently listening to music and puttering around the house. I'm a bit in love with this strain right now... ",5,trainwreck
birdup311,"This is my favorite strain. Trainwreck energized me quickly, gave me a huge boost of creativity, and a euphoric and super happy high.

Gfunk007,"Great old school taste considering the lineage. What a great strain for focus, calming energy and an overall laid back vibe. Great wake and bake...hell this is even good at night!

MajikNinja319,"This strain is KILLER! I can 100% say this is the strongest hybrid I have ever smoked. Until i grew used to its affects, I would at times consider myself &quot;too high.&quot; Which does not too often happen to me and i was never uncomfortable at that level, it was a great feeling. Its a great mix of body and mind but the mind is definitely the super noticeable side of it. The sativa shines through and conquers unless you're really trying to relax which i love because i find too many hybrids are indica dominant. This is my current favorite hybrid.",5,trainwreck
thefishingkid,"My favorite strain to date.. a get up and go high but can also double down as a lazy high. It's so exhilarating, I feel extremely kind and my anxiety is blown away.

mindfuck420,best strain for Ptsd and anxiety I've found so far. ,0,trainwreck
TheRealMrsMVP,"I love this strain. I have anxiety, panic attacks, depression, fibromyalgia, PTSD and more. (The event from the PTSD triggered everything else, including the fibromyalgia, as I was young) Anyway, this strain helps me to focus, feel creative, and feel like I'm thinking about normal things, rather than obsessing over nonsense that I can't change anyway. Also, I'm a fat ass, and since I have started experimenting with legal weed, I feel that I can control my cravings more. Yes, some make my munchies go through the roof, but after two months of smoking/vaping daily, I can safely say I feel my appetite is going down, even when not high. I also am not having as many nightmares, or night terrors. This does not seem to exacerbate my paranoid anxiety about my physical health. I am not feeling any pain right now, and I'm writing all this, so at least I'm still somewhat articulate.",5,trainwreck
RavenFoxAudio,"Powerful sativa effects, with a little relaxation thrown in.  It took care of my pain, anxiety and made it possible for me to continue working on my script.",5,trainwreck
jaysixx,"this strain provided an extremely quick cerebral head high followed by faint tingling sensations shooting throughout my lower abdomen like a warm pulsating blanket of absolute &amp; unparalleled acceptance &amp; understanding. obliterating every aspect of anxiety, this strain will leave you feeling as though there is no true past or future, only now. ",4,trainwreck
AssumetheWorst,"This is such an Amazing strain, some of the highest euphoric feelings derive from it. 10/10 would recommend ",5,trainwreck
sluttypickle69,Really did hit me like a train wreck in two hits I was gone no more pain no more anxiety had a great experience would recommend for people who get anxious easily if youâ€™re an experienced smoker you will enjoy this ,5,trainwreck
birchsbse,Holy fucking shit dude this strain is the bomb. I'm like very oh so high on this strain right now and boy isn't life great? It's killing my anxiety 100% it's crushing my back pain and it's making me happyyyyyyy happey ;) I would recommend to any stoner and cannabis lover like myself and anybody in earth that needs this beautiful natural earth medicine â˜®ï¸è,5,trainwreck
rusty_fwg,great for my muscle stress and chilled out my eye and head strain. lasted for a good amount of time and didn't really couch me but did put into a good state of mind,5,trainwreck
Telperion69,"finally, after 10 years of BS, I got what I'm convinced is the 'Arcata' Trainwreck. Long, sticky, lime green and rusty colored buds that have a piney musk hiding some deep lemon echo in the exhale - sweeter and becoming more earthy as it cures. Great daytime, creative high. I seem to find myself playing guitar often when I have a stone like this one. It is a fine example of what a sativa dominant hybrid can strive to be, but unfortunately, I'd have to say it did not live up to all the hype. ",3,trainwreck
faeriegirl,"This strain is very potent. It's harsh on the lungs and has thick, aggressive smoke. That being said, it'll fuck a bitch up. It's a very aware, active high. A funny, giggly high.",4,trainwreck
Iconindy,"Kicks like a pack mule, and has you coughing immediately. This is followed quickly by a nice head and body high that can cause an intense illusion of numbness of the face and fingers. High lasts about an hour, maybe two. ",5,trainwreck
Gelid,"Effects come later than usual, and are the strongest from 30 minutes after smoking to 2 hours after smoking. After 2 hours I felt extremely tired. The high lasted between 4 and 5 hours. Probably the most talkative and thoughtful highs I've had so far with no negative effects other than some manageable paranoia and sleepiness. Recommended for nighttime smoking.",4,trainwreck
King.jku,"So here I am thinking this was going to be an easy hit. I take a few hits and I did not feel anything. I think to myself this is weak. As I'm sitting I play the same thought in my head about how I wasted my money, then there it was. It hit me like a baseball bat and instantly I had the best head high. I sat there and finished my blunt and at that moment in time, I know this was the not a light strain. I was not lost out my mind and I was able to buzz sit back, relax, and admire such a delicate bud. HIGHLY recommended for depression!",5,trainwreck
ChimeraLDM,Trainwreck is a fantastic day time strain that kept me energetic and swaying back and forth listening to music. I found that Trainwerck helped me with my ADD and I was able to focus more on task and keep to them like writing this review. Great stain if your working out skateboarding or just acting dumb dancing to music in your room.,5,trainwreck
Blueberryhog,For a seasoned smoker of 28 years I have to say Trainwreck is the strain to get when ur hitting the can't get hi anymore level . This strain can go either way couch lock and munchies or energetic creativity either way it will knock out ur pain and put a smile on ur face not the greatest strain if u suffer from severe anxiety u should micro dose until u feel comfortable ... Taste like old school weed to me usually smooth nice lung expansion with  inhale noticeably more lemon and pine taste on exhale if ur lucky to get a good batch it will have a slight menthol hint at the end,4,trainwreck
omnigold,"Experiencing Trainwreck for the 1st time just now with a vape pen... The 1st hit was more spice than lime, strong! No buzz yet but you can feel that train a comin! Hit #2, you will not forget this distinctive flavor. I detect notes of mint, spice and lime, a spicy Mojito! Then you'll cough and cough and cou-and you'll feel the train wreck happen, it doesn't creep up on ya, it comes on strong with a clear understanding how the name came about. However, the buzz finishes by taking you on a long over due train ride across the wild west and your ready for whatever action that comes your way... enjoy! choo choooooo",5,trainwreck
Mrsfeelgolden,"This strain made me feel very uppity, and euphoric. It's my new favorite! Heady, but productive, fun high. I was very high, but verbally articulate on this strain, so that is also a plus.",5,trainwreck
boyndog,"Not merely a good strain -- a GREAT strain.    On a normal working day (I write for a living), I line up the strains -- GG4 to begin the day (always) then onto Blue Dream (almost always) then onto Durban Poison and/or White Widow (depending on the flow of thoughts).  It's a virtually foolproof flow of warm feelings and intense, damn-the-torpedoes ideas, notions, bits of character &amp; dialogue or whatever's on the docket.  And then SOME writing days are REALLY special -- and they deserve an extra special gear.  That's when I break out the TRAINWRECK.  It's pure awesomeness -- with a head high that comes on strong and effervescent.  Great for multi-tasking.  Great for staring intently at things and understanding how they work on a  nuts n bolts level.  Great for bringing out the very best in you.",5,trainwreck
boudreaux,"Train wreck, Plane wreck, or Car wreck. That's what you get. Tried both the shatter &amp; flower, both were realllly good. First it wrecks you going up, then this shit wrecks you on the down-side. Not a bad smoke, give it a try and hear the clickety clack of them wheels baby!",4,trainwreck
blueandorangedream,Good classic strain gets me smacked mad quick and doesn't put me to sleep. Been smoking it out of my metal pipe/bowl and the hits are harsh but effective,4,trainwreck
sweetbrowngentry,Prepare to be &quot;train-wrecked&quot; with this strain! I felt a nice body-high and generally uplifted as well as giggly and somewhat talkative.  This seems to be a good stress and pain-relieving strain. But watch out: too much of it and you'll be spending the day couch-locked!,4,trainwreck
leemec,"I vape Trainwreck out of a Dart pod from INSA and I love it. It is a focused day time high with few to no munchies. I get no dry eye and minimal cotton mouth too. The high lasts a long time and keeps me moving and on task. The come down is easy too. No lethargy nor headache. The taste of the vape is pleasant and leaves no recognizable odor in the air. I would describe it as fresh, flowery with a hint of pine. Great strain. Highly recommend it.",5,trainwreck
StonedMoonPie,"I mostly remember this strain because the dispensary jokingly renamed it &quot;Donald Trump&quot;!  A nice hybrid mixed strain that I enjoy! Thought it would really knock me out from the name but the mix of Indica and Sativa let you; relax but not melt into the couch, keeps your mind active but your not bouncing with energy! A good mix to keep you calm and up. Good for a mid day high but you don't wanna dive into Indica's till the evening. Sadly don't remember it having much smell but what I did smell was very nice! _Ÿ_‚",4,trainwreck
StonedDevilDoc,A cerebral invigoration to remember and pain to forget. Dealing with a messed up spine plus psych issues is a combo that I wouldn't wish on anyone . But this strain in concentrate form for me makes the afternoons seem a little less challenging. Able to get up and move around and to do the normal things in life such as brushing your teeth or grooming. Not an urge of couch lock or hunger. Just a head euphoria and slight body buzz but there is pain relief.,5,trainwreck
Post83G,Anyone who sees my reviews know Iâ€™m not a sativa fan. I do love the flavor of this trainwreck Iâ€™m smokin but donâ€™t care for the zippyness that accompanies it. If you got shit to do this is for you but it gives me a little anxiety... oh well ima still smoke it tho_Ÿ˜‚,3,trainwreck
Katiebug2,"Itâ€™s my favorite! A Great daytime, helps with Pain, inflammation, fatigue,headaches, anxiety (for some) concentration and overall happy peaceful feeling.. Itâ€™s my daytime go to, even great for night. But I love Dosido or 9lb hammer for night. Trainwreck has a great taste too,  piney lemon flavor. Wakes you up a bit.. Feelin all right! _Ÿç‹_ŸŒ»âœŒ_Ÿè__Ÿ_—",5,trainwreck
WetLettuce0,"This strain is very wonderful Iâ€™m smoking on Kingpen Trainwreck. Itâ€™s very potent and there is a lot of flavor. I wanna say itâ€™s very herbal and spicy kind of. A hint of lemon and a small drag of skunk taste near the aftertaste. Very tasty tho lots of good flavor. The effects are uplifting, happiness, I wanna say a bit of alertness just  good vibes. _Ÿ_™ I have ADD/ADHD and this strain is perfect for people like me who have a lot of anxiety and worry and over think things a lot and just need to chill out. Itâ€™s pretty groovy tho homies. I would recommend this cart. ",5,trainwreck
Coachgomezz,"My favorite strain I have tried to date. The amount of pure happiness you get is out of this world. Went on a hike a little over five miles and smoked train wreck before and experienced nature completely new. Each view was worth beholding a few extra seconds and breathing into. Each bird call was a happy song, such a great strain to explore the world through. Also lasts quite a while. ",5,trainwreck

MP777,"Great for stress, anxiety, depression. Very euphoric strain. Happiness and positivity emanates from out of you once you get this good holy herb in your system, itâ€™s f*ckinâ€™ percect. I definitely feel creative on this strain and not racy at all, itâ€™s a nice ride! Very mellow &amp; peaceful. Itâ€™s very versatile as I can be artistic on this strain, or chill and take a nap. A++ Heavy resin on these buds btw. The balance betwwen body and head is so amazing and feels so natural, youâ€™re just in bliss on this bad boy! I hope yâ€™all get a chance to enjoy some too!",5,trainwreck
Thedank26,One of my top ten. This is a great great weed. Big dense nugs covered in crytals. smell is great has a spicy weed smell. Wen I smoked this it opened my mind it was a wild high loved every min of it. Only bought a quarter and wished i had got more. Dont see it much but track it down from across the country on net and placed an order. got 2 oz here in 48 hours. Now i can ride the train for at least 60 days if i go easy. But a difinate winner.,5,trainwreck
WheresToto,Relaxed. Peaceful. Tasty. I always buy it when I find it.,5,trainwreck
dentalbook,"I just got some outdoor I believe. The high was probaly remeniscient of the old haze high! I have some outdoor pics on this site. This is what cannabissearch.com said:   Train Wreck Marijuana Description  A lemony, mentholy 90/10 Sativa/Indica cross, Train Wreck medical cannabis is some of the most potently blissful on the planet. The word is that we owe our thanks to a couple of brother growers from California for creating the world-famous Lowland Thai/Mexican spattered-with-a-hint-of-primo Afghani marijuana strain. This happened somewhere in the late 70's. Word is they pulled their crop early because a train had wrecked nearby and they didn't want the emergency crews discovering it. And then, somewhere in time, a clone was gifted, stolen or otherwise chanced upon - and the Train Wreck weed strain took off mainstream!",4,trainwreck
lionsmanefl,"LIVING LEGEND! This strain has peaked my interest since before I even smoked. For the first time I got my hands on it and it is everything I dreamed of! Thick beautiful buds that were nice and fluffy and super sticky, some of them even had some purple packed i there. It burns great and isnâ€™t hard on your throat because it shoots straight to your lungs and has a boxing match in your chest. Instant euphoria! Was extremely pine tasting for me and had a lot of that smell coming from deep within the bud. I recommend for people doing creative work or for even people that love expression. WARNING: smoking a bunch of it will leave you on your ass haha. Itâ€™s supple but strong!",5,trainwreck
hsoj97,"This is one of the best tasting and acting buds I've had. The mental experience is a classic feeling I haven't had in a long time.It is great for doing anything really, outside,inside, You could take a nap or go skate if ya want to! fantastic ",5,trainwreck
Ratherbefishing,A get up and go high. Doesnâ€™t leave you feeling lazy. Good motivator. Smoked from an outdoor plant.,4,trainwreck
Felton18,"Uff. I love this strain. So many crystals in the buds. Smells like pines, and lemon and limes. The taste is kind of peppery _Ÿ_”. The high comes on slowly. But when it hits, by that time you would've already been high. Lots of Euphoria, Light looks beautiful with this strain. Taste buds are enhanced. Music sounds just perfect. I feel so good. Has you often stare off in dream like trances. Perfect for a 5pm smoke _Ÿ˜_",5,trainwreck
Dystopialloon,"Lordy mama, I may have a new favorite strain. The euphoria is so potent I feel like my head is exploding (but in a good way). Itâ€™s energizing but not racy, and it left me feeling calm, creative, focused, and incredibly good about my place in the world and my ability to accomplish what I need to do. I have issues with depression, anxiety and ADD and this strain is amazing for me. Will definitely become one of my go-to medicines. ",5,trainwreck

RoadH0use,"I think this strain is wonderful. Smells amazing, super potent, smokes smooth and slow. Not to mention, tastes great.

Thatâ€™s really the only way to say it.",5,trainwreck

Look: 8.8 - Chubby tight cony bud with a lot of trichomes.  Effect: 9.2 - Put you in your bubble after the first hit without putting you to sleep, big head high.  Final verdict: 9.1 - One of my favorite hybrid strain!",5,trainwreck

I have good memories in my late teens / early 20's of always being ultra gassed after scoring some of this or back in the day ak-47.  It's a classic- if you havnt tried it , you have to .  Strains now are so much more complex and potent but this girl will always hold a piece my heart. Rating this strain can be tricky. I can't count how many batches I've seen - and I'd say 1/3 have been that kill. 9.1/10",5,trainwreck
ddknndys118,I actually had a Trainwreck x LA Confidential cross that was referred to as LA Trainwreck by the grower. This was a perfect blend of the two strains. I am writing this review under Trainwreck because it felt more cerebral and sativa based than indica. Nice blend of the spicy taste of LA Conf and the fruitier Trainwreck. 8,4,trainwreck

Pineapplecough,"I've had several strains called Trainwreck that were distinctly different.   The first was described by my dealer at the time as a heavy, caffeinating sativa and heavy and caffeinating, it was. After smoking, I dutifully cleaned my friend's entire apartment and made slutty brownies. Then sat down to write some music. The entire time, I enjoyed a steady stream of lively, intense thinking. One of the most sativa-y sativas I've had to this day.   Since then, I've only ever had hybrids and sativa-dom hybrids from rec stores called Trainwreck and it's been good, but not as good. It's thought-provoking, but not thought-inspiring. I feel creative, but I don't quite have the energy to act on it. It's still great for music, sex, taking walks, sensory experiences, movies/tv. It's pretty euphoric and heady but somewhat low energy.  Maybe I'm just nostalgic for that first experience, but when I hear &quot;Trainwreck&quot; I expect to be completely knocked flat by my own train of thought. Still, a great strain either way though and its popularity is well-deserved.",5,trainwreck

Zxvasdf,"Every strain is different for every person  Itâ€™s a dark and stormy night and I hesitate at the beginning of my account, filled with fearful thoughts and despairing doubts, exacerbated by the calamity outside. Turning my tale to paper and pen would conjure my plight out of the abstract thought, into reality, and concrete its status as Incontrovertible Truth, viewable by all who may read my words.   That night... there are flashes of rushing red against a dark grey wall that halved the part of the world that was lit. I understood later that I had fallen. No, if I am to believe my friendâ€™s account, I leaped of my own volition.   We were engaged in games of prestidigitation, the atmosphere immediate to our faces shifting, the buzzing light above shining through layers of smoke as we sipped from generously filled, expertly rolled cigarillos. It was of the highest quality, medical grade, well worth the extra expenditure of funds out of pocket. It was a new strain, rolled out with fanfare by our resident pusher.   Trainwreck BX2.   I had to pause a moment for itâ€™s the first Iâ€™ve dared utter its name outside the confines of my nightmares. When I came to, shaking myself from my stupor like a wet dog, hours had passed and yet the storm hasnâ€™t abated, seeming to increase in ferocity the faster I wrote.   I leaped face-first into the concrete. My friend was reasonably freaked. When I came to, all red below my nose, currently queerly shaped, I took my phone and calmly ordered for pizza in a pool of my own blood. When it arrived, the blood had congealed and I was able to sit up, becoming sufficiently restored after the pizza to continue our cardfoolery.   Trainwreck...  Please, donâ€™t allow my tortured account to lead you to believe that this strain is as monstrous or powerful as I make it out to be; I had neglected to imbibe enough water. And itâ€™s true I dally in reacquainting myself with this strain, but itâ€™s only because of the forgetful nature that comes with being a connoisseur.   Whether you believe my tale or not, merely knowing it is out there to be read, is enough. I am unburdened, and if that is not the case, I FEEL unburdened.    ",4,trainwreck

The last time I smoked this strain I took my dog on a walk for 4 days and didnâ€™t know where the fuck I was. train wreck should be one of your go to strains to get stoned to the bone I once got so high I forgot how to master bate and just started to slam my wiener on to a pole I know at that moment the weed had taken over and I was completely fucked i dumped a half a bottle of clear eyes into my eyes but my eyes were still more red than a bambooâ€™s ass. one bong rip of some train wreck should send your average man onto his rectum hole crying for his mammaâ€™s titty and to geeked for another hit ,5,trainwreck
flythekite,"I have smoked a lot of strains before, but nothing comes close to this. I was watching The Office while high in this and i completely zoned in and it felt like i was in the show.

hipchick62,"Having trouble with severe pain,swelling &amp; fluid in my knee nearly 8 weeks after surgery which unfortunately, causes me to get very depressed.

maktown,"Unfortunately, I have to give this strain two thumbs down. I didn't feel a damn thing after smoking this. I'm hoping that this is an isolated incident and I got a bad batch from my local dispensary â€“â€“ Canopi on Blue Diamond Rd., here in Las Vegas Nevada â€“â€“ I have ran into this situation with certain strains though. Perhaps these stains have no 'chemistry' with MY body chemistry. Louis the XIII and Head Cheese are some other strains that don't really do anything for me and I've smoked these strains multiple times from multiple growers/sellers. I did think it was odd that the bud was very dry straight out the package and the THC% level was only 9%. Oh well, better luck next time.",1,trainwreck

SebadohGPB,The first time I smoked this strain was about a year and a half ago. I was sitting in my room with a few shirts over my lamp so my room was dark and comfortable. I went outside and pulled some gravity bongs with a big Arizona gallon jug and a bucket inside of the abandoned house across from me. I was laying in my bed enjoying her effects and relaxing to the sound of my favorite band... Sebadoh. I saw small faint outlines of color lining the boards in my ceiling and I was starting to feel paranoid. I took this strain camping with my family and I was walking around the long road that stretched across the campsite. I was walking down a gravel road and it looked as if everything was a video game. I felt happy and tired but at the same time I felt like I was up for an adventure.  This strain is very nostalgic for me and I would smoke t again. But not all the time. Just enough to enjoy the bright colors on my SNES or to go for a walk and feel like Iâ€™m living a video game.,4,trainwreck

I seem to have a preference of the face/head/body buzz of sativas and sativa leaning hybrids and damn, this is good stuff.    Comes on strong and fast, makes for an excellent strain to just get lost in yourself and your music.   Has the potential to be excellent for sex too.  I'm looking forward to getting ahold of the Ultimate Trainwreck and Jillybean for that experience as well, but this strain is at the top, just slightly above Jack Herer as a monumental experience.",5,trainwreck

shelbikate,"Another one of my TOP 3 FAVORITE STRAINS. This is not a strain for beginners. This bud makes all of your senses heighten like your hearing and sight.

Great if you like to work out after smoking. ",5,trainwreck
DocBravo,"Ok, I'm a relatively new smoker, so take that into consideration when reading this post... It's probably not a good idea to smoke anything named after a catastrophe for the 2nd strain you've ever tried (That was my bad). I tried trainwreck twice. The first time it donkey kicked me in the chest, singed my torso follicles, riddled me with famine,  and put me to bed... all in the span of 15 mins!  (...4 hours later) I awoke with a full head buzz and a desire to consume things that have been in my pantry since I moved in 3 years ago.  After the first &quot;Train Ride&quot; I figured it was safe to give it another go about a week later (This was Saturday)... I wouldn't feel safe for the next 2 days... The buzz this time was IMMEDIATE! I barely had time to put away my water pipe, before the &quot;Train left the Station&quot; ....destination: THE SUNKEN PLACE! That's the only way to really describe the next 3 hours. Straight out of the Movie &quot;Get Out&quot;, I proceeded to get nauseous, and retract into my own body (minus the tea stirring spoon). It was as if time stood still. Seconds felt like minutes, minutes like hours! I could see my life happening in front of me, but I was simply a spectator.  Everything I wanted to do took extreme effort and concentration. After riding in the car with my Wifey, we came home after about 45 (which felt like 45 hours), and I laid down for about 2 hours. Though I felt a little better, the nausea was still noticeable,  but I was able to eat.  I woke up Sunday a little sluggish, with nausea, but still a little better.  What really suprised me was I still felt high on Monday, 2 days later!  Lesson Learned: Don't expect something called &quot;TrainWreck&quot; to feature Thomas the Tank Engine... be prepared for Ozzie Osborne's &quot;Crazy Train!&quot; ",1,trainwreck
Kimberley,"The first time I tried this, it really hit me...hard. I am glad I was smart enough to take a hit...wait, another hit...wait &amp; so on. At about four hits I stopped. In retrospect, I should have stopped at two. Never the less,  I felt confused...yet creative, I made the most inspired floral arrangement. Then I made the mistake of sitting down. I felt as if I had melded together with the sofa. I think I did because, I had 3 hrs. to get everything in order &amp; get ready to go out for the evening. The next time I looked at the clock I only had an hour left to get everything done! Had it not been such an important evening, I would have been content to stay conjoined to the couch.  This strain could go either way depending on your mood...creative &amp; energetic or a complete crash &amp; burn or should I say burn &amp; crash?  A little goes a looong way. The only real negative that I have for this strain is that with an extended repeat use of Trainwreck, I tend to feel more edgy &amp; the potential threat of a panic attack feels as if it is looming in the wings. This strain I like to reserve for pain or insomnia. It isn't one of my favorites as it doesn't give me that warm, lovey, comforting feeling that I like. Instead, it is intense, jarring in an almost shocking manner &amp; and then you are left laid to waste.",3,trainwreck

someguy2448,"Walked on the streets for over 2 hours while listening to music. Very uplifting out of body experience. You also start to get very creative. Your mind is overflowing with ideas. You can also feel the wind very nicely. Wind makes you tingly. Everything seems like a dream or footage of a music video.  Can make you a little dizzy sometimes. Makes you very relaxed to the point you would easily sleep. You FEEL the music. Music is heaven with this strain, especially 90s rock or any music you listened to as a kid. ",4,ak-47
blorgish,"This AK-47 is gorgeously coated in golden trichomes. Nicely dense buds and broad leaved. Grinds out to become very puffy to reveal the density. Smoking out of a normal 1 perk bong with ice. Had a minimal breakfast and have been awake for 2 hours and I am smoking about 0.35g. Toke 1: Very nice earthy taste, slow developing cerebral euphoria with a slight feeling of eye pressure.  Toke 2: Hits hard but only reverberates minor coughs. Lungs feel fine. Heightened cerebral high. Toke 3 and 4 back-to-back: delivers a huge cherried hit and a minor cough. Already a sense of the intensely developing cerebral stoned euphoria.  Toke 5: Bowl simmers to a left-over small one hit before it's cached. continuing effects from earlier.  Last Half-Hit: Ash pulled through. no hit  :(  Now, the high. Music gives a body sense high. Overwhelming happiness in the music, laughing and smiling from ear to ear. Urge to dance or your body feels uncomfortable. I feel each thing that touches my body including hair falling on forehead in different places.   I'm going to get more food now definitely want to sit down and relax and smile.  Making food now, but I won't waste your time with my jibber jabber.",5,ak-47
MZ_PHD_in_420,"I have 40+ years experience growing and using cannabis, a masters degree in agri/horticulture from MSU and will break each review down as follows from my own personal experience with seeds or clones obtained directly from the original breeders, in this case Serious Seeds: - Use; Sativa effects, happy, euphoric, relaxed, great for depression, anxiety, stress, motivation and daytime use.  It is a very nice strain with mostly sativa type effects, happy, euphoric, relaxed yet not to the point of making you unmotivated. If anything, it actually motivates you and it's great for daytime use. This is a perfect strain for depression, anxiety, stress, motivation and creativity. The buds are nice and dense and have a very nice fruity smell and taste with a very smooth smoke. Grow; Indoors: She can be finished in 7-8 weeks. - Outdoors: It's an excellent and a great choice if you live in a cooler area where plants need to finish earlier and you still want something with strong sativa effects. At 42*N latitude she started flowering the last week of July and was ready around the third week of September, contrary to Leafly's estimate. - Very easy to grow both indoors and out. Plants have a distinct sativa leaf that is very narrow and grow in the typical pine tree look. The best thing about this strain is it's sativa dominance in effect and look, yet it has the Afghan gene that will make her finish very fast for a sativa, with very little stretching once flowering is induced. Has a high leaf to bud ratio in volume but not by weight as there are a lot of leaves to trim but most are very small and narrow. Strain seemed very stable with little variation between phenotypes. Very similar to my AK-48 review except AK-47 will finish even sooner but is a little less aromatic.",4,ak-47

Doublepinkeye,"A deep toke from the Timeless vape, another long day in the books. A familiar feeling begins crawling up your back. It settles in just at the back of your head. What is this feeling you ask? It's a small gang of figurative Somali pirates lurking within this strain...they have an agenda, to steal all of your stress and anxiety away. Once they put the AK-47 in your face, you know they're in control.  The vapor whispers into your ear as you exhale &quot;I'm the Captain now.&quot; Take a puff and let your troubles be stolen from you. This strain will wage war on your worries, enjoy! ",5,ak-47

It did not disappoint, very good at reducing nausea while at the same time very energetic with an uplifted mood, not euphoric by any means but felt good.  At times I felt I was prone to chatter quickly but could have been in my mind.  As long as it's available I would have it around as part of my daytime mix.  A very small downside for me is the after taste of a diesel, chemical or sour bitter taste, when vaping.  It does smooth out after a tug or two.",5,ak-47

But at least ak-47 does make me fell normal again, and it is the only reason i give it a 9, if i havent smoked any strains for over 2 weeks ak-47 well give me an immediate rush after i exhale, it is in my opionion extremely short and i have to smoke it for the rest of the week just to not go in to the horrible depression of my life but i consisder it the best anti depressant by far, if youve been smoking a lot more than normal people i will warn you, this strain will stop getting you high but you will feel so much more happier about everything its worth it.",4,ak-47
akamaru,"I love ak-47 but don't plan on being productive if you smoke this. This is one of the &quot;stereotypical&quot; college stoner strains. Get ready to stink up the place, kick back, lose track of time, and chill with your friends. Your mind will go places, with or without your body. Perfect for watching movies or listening to music. Knocks you out if you need a good night's sleep.",3,ak-47
doobwalker,"AK-47.   The name conjures images of Rambo mowing down redneck republicans while screaming &quot;they drew first blood, sarge!&quot; Fortunately, while AK-47 certainly has the power of its namesake, you won't be experiencing Sly Stallone dripping sweat all over you.    A good balanced hybrid, I would judge this about an even 50/50 between the sativa and indica effects.   The head space is good- mellow, pleasant but motivated.  The body effects are just enough to be there- killing your pain, but not your motivations.  Taste is actually rather complex- skunk and floral notes compete with a curious earthiness at the back of your throat while a sweet sensation covers your tongue as the thick smoke curls and expands.  Speaking of that smoke... this is a cougher.  After repeated use, I noticed a pronounced harshness/menthol feeling at the back of the throat.  Maybe this was because I had shatter than flower... but it was unpleasant enough that a beverage is a required accessory when medicating.  Didn't stop me though, and I even went back for a second batch.  That says something.  Not stellar, but a very good everyday &quot;go-to&quot; that does what it should.  All in all, a very pleasant and well balanced hybrid that effectively riddles your pain and stress with a barrage of semi-automatic bullets... without leaving you bleeding out in the dirt from a sucking chest wound.  Form:  Concentrate (HYH Society Shatter) Tokes/Hits to effect: 3 to 4 Taste: Skunk/Flower/Earth/Menthol Cough Level:  Well, I only need one lung anyway... Final Verdict:  Recommended.",4,ak-47
jack123,"Great bud.... Very indica heavy. I smoked about 2.5g with a friend (we both use it for pain, so we usually smoke together). After smoking you feel dizzy, but that goes away in like 2 minutes. After that you feel like you are wearing a very tight hat. Your temples feel like they have something pushing on them. It feels pretty nice. This goes away after 10-15 minutes. Most of my peak period was spent eating and drinking because I had some dry mouth and hunger. This isn't a very social strain. Its a nice strain for burning by yourself to some music. Manages pain and stress very well. I would give this a 7 because its strong for a while, but about 60 minutes after smoking it totally goes away leaving you with a &quot;hung over&quot; feeling. This carried on for hours and kinda sucked. I would reccomend rolling joints with 2/3 of this, and 1/3 sativa dominant strain (see blue dream, green crack, etc). This takes some of the laziness and hang over away. Without this sativa its very easy to crash because this is GREAT for insomnia. Congrats to anyone who has made it to the end of this..... I'm pretty stoned on this stuff right now, so this has kind of rambled. Hope everyone finds this helpful.   -Cheers  ",3,ak-47
mattny,"I found ak mentally engaging and uplifting while sedating on the body, a nice toe tingler. Great combo for daytime relief of stress and depression, moderate pain relief and appetite stimulant. Can put me in a creative headspace in the proper setting. This herb can really pull the veil down and open your third eye which some might not be ready to experience. Pleasurable mentally and physically on Chakra centers in the body, spiritually enlightening herb _Ÿ_—",4,ak-47
spacejunkOG,"This is the strain I smoke when I've been smoking all day and have built up a massive tolerance, because it can bring me back and kick my ass unlike any other strain.  Every batch from every grower will have different THC content but there's something about this stuff that seems so STRONG, I guess that's why they named it what they did.  Buzz:  Quick euphoric up high for a bit then a pretty pronounced crash very characteristic of skunk strains.  Smell:  f**in craaaazy.  The pungency and spiciness of trainwreck with a bit more fruitiness (similar genetics to Trainwreck, a mishmash of worldwide landraces).  Just sour and pungent and nasty but in the best possible way. I always keep this one around.",5,ak-47

curlysgod,"This is my review of AK47, a Sativa dominant hybrid.  The effects are Euphoric, happy relaxed, focused and UPLIFTED!  I tried this at night time, lol.  I do not recommend it for sleep.  This gives you a heady high that keeps you alert and reduces fatigue allowing for me to perform my daily tasks with ease.  Or just sit back and write a review.  This has a sweet earthy pine flavor, and smells like fresh cut grass in the vaporizer.",5,ak-47
Bzjane7,by far one of my favorite all time strains I loved the energy behind it and the creativity state of mind it put me in. there's never a bad time to have the trigger pulled in the AK 47 as soon as you hit it welcome to a more live happy world my friend!!! ,5,ak-47

lexustap,"This strain is in my current top 3 as a chronic medical user, and for me it's great in a low to moderate amount. I do enjoy the high with this when it's not too intense. Right now I am appreciating the effects of it following surgery I just had yesterday. My doc wrote me a prescription for Norco and I thought &quot;I won't be needing that,&quot; my AK 47 has been doing nicely. So I am laying around the house recovering today enjoying the company of my three cats, having just watched an animated kids' movie on Netflix and thinking about how it must be different (easier?) to be a writer of a kids' cartoon movie than a regular show: you don't go into it expecting it to make sense in real life, so you can just go with the absurdity of it all and have fun with it. Otherwise this strain gets me into finding mistakes or oddities in shows that I would not pick up on when I wasn't using. It's a relaxing, ever-so-slightly energizing high. I use it in a Pax 2 vaporizer with the setting on 2, and I take about half a dozen good hits off of it to get a nice pleasant high, nearly complete pain relief, no more nausea, and a better place to have my brain mentally/emotionally than wrapped up in all of the medical stuff I've had going on over the past year. I'll definitely have to get more of this once I've run out.",5,ak-47
surfzen88,"I really liked this strain until the come down. It's a very clear high, no anxiety (at first), light body feel. I first had it sitting on the porch outside and if you are sitting, you'll stay sitting, but I didn't feel stuck there. It made me ponder nature, very creative thoughts. I decided to try some again before a hike. What I discovered about this strain is that it makes you focus. I didn't notice much when I was up walking around, but when I sat by a creek, I became intrigued by the water and the light. People came by and I wasn't especially talkative, so I wouldn't take it to socialize. I actually liked this one until a few hours later when I experienced a very depressing emotional shift that felt &quot;chemical&quot; to me and was very dark. It gave me a panic attack.  I'm not really prone to depression, but i hated the way I felt and nothing seemed to make it better for hours. For that reason, I wouldn't try AK-47 again. It wasn't worth it even though the actual high was enjoyable.  Also, it's a stupid name.  The high is mellow but they name it after a violent weapon?  That's just dumb. On second thought, it did have me panicking about imminent destruction at a certain point so maybe that's not too far off.",3,ak-47

Cygnus,"I noticed a lot of peculiar things when smoking AK-47, but I will try to be simple. I had some popcorn I believe, in which I smoked via a glass pipe. The buds had a large trichrome presence, and a musty smell to it. It burned rather quickly as well. The buzz took about ten minutes to settle in after a couple of large bowls shared across four people. Four three of us, it enabled a happy, uplifting, relaxing buzz that couch locked one of the three, and gave the other two of us a creative state of mind. The fourth f us was a heavy ADD patient who was looking to try something different than pills. HIS buzz was very energetic, very intense, and very opposite of the rest of us (he is not a usual smoker though).  All in all, AK-47 is a great strain with a long enduring buzz at times. Not for the lightweights!!",4,ak-47
atozz,"*note, not for the new kids.  If you are a seasoned smoker then grab a bag of this bud.

AlpacaMyBooty,"Make it rain AK47!  My absolute favourite firecracker that sends me to the moon and beyond. As Team Rocket says... We're blasting off again!!   This will send you off like crack and then make your knuckles drag only to leave you utterly embarrassing yourself by not being able to speak properly and then walking face first into a hotel sliding door. It hits you very quickly with a sudden shower of bullets leaving you dancing your feet until there's nothing left of them to slam you down slow for a little while before making it rain once more. It is a pungent and harsh smoke regardless but it is more than worth it.   I have severe anxiety and OCD at 23, I am als female. So much relief. No anxiety, no nausea or panic attacks or insomnia, speech problems, vision problems, lethargy or worsening of my OCD which I get with every Indica I smoke. I love AK because it makes me feel really good and like I can actually go out and see things. My boyfriend and I first tried this in Amsterdam and practically bought the whole of Amsterdam's worth to sit and smoke throughout the visit.   I would warn people if you haven't tried AK47 to get a gravity bottle, find someone to sit with you and be blown outergalactic.   I found this so uplifting with strong sativa traits. My heart was pounding and I couldn't stop dancing and laughing and jumping around. My depressed boyfriend was exactly the same and he was laughing and experienced a good relief from his illness!   Absolutely love AK. There is nothing that could compare to that beautiful AK47 that will spray you down again and again.",5,ak-47

I'm thinking of new ideas and conversing with my session partner about general mechanics (cars, trucks, gears, ratios, engines, ect.) as I am mechanically inclined. I'm also having a very nice and relaxing body mood. I feel as if i have a heavy yet extremly soft and comftorable blanket on me. Its very soothing and feels awesome after a hard days work.   With all this said, i conclude with this. This strain of cannibas is by far one of the best strains I've expirienced for having a relaxing high. I'd highly reccommend this to anyone who is exauhsted after a hard days work or anyone who is just looking to chill! ",5,ak-47
BIGPAPAKUSH,"2 words, Straight Gas, this strain lives up to his Russian name. AK-47 hits like brick wall, if it could run, talk, and think of all the ways it can fuck you. Simply put this strain offers a great high with a balanced dose of head and body high. Once you get over the first come up you begin to fall into the mellowness of the high. Thoughts of &quot;is my heart working&quot; turn into &quot;do I want to fry this&quot;.... and we all know the fucking answer to that. In terms of taste, I hit this through a vape. Definitely some earthy tones but nothing that I really need to rave about. Just tastes good, and does it job aesthetically (or at least the shit that I picked up).  I would recommend this to someone who just needs to chill. Like they are annoying as fuck when they are high, but you through ak-47 there way so they can chill. ENJOY!!!!!",5,ak-47

The hue of this nugget is coated in a wide spectrums of gold n white maybe the cbn showing? Fox tailing with auburn hairs at the peak of this bud dark green leafs and small boulder shoulders and the bottom puff out like a dress and scoops up away from it's stem, very dank as well as tough to break apart leaves you with sticky fingers. The heavy head high comes with a nice warm sensation you'd feel on the summer day when the sun starts to warm up your body an absolute must have for these bitter cold winter days. Feeling happy and energetic it feels wonderful having no stress and doing what has to be done, allows me to even fit reading and music practice in as well. I love the true ak-47 that lets me feel this way. I have had other said &quot;ak-47's&quot; and their genetics don't match this true linotypes they don't lie. I have found one con if taken more than a few times a day I can get very dizzy on this. It's well worth it the first few times, other than that I'd have to switch it tastes like. Chemical wood like and pungent, herbal/pepper. I found this helpful for my concentration ADHD, my eye's Glaucoma, there seems to be some fade-in's n outs' to this tinnitus for this as long as you have a small amount of music in the background your ears don't ring as much, or not at all i've found it helps there, small pain numbing, but not much more on the visuals, depression and stress are gone.

lukem99,"This strain would earn a 5/5 were it not for the abysmal come down, but other than that, it's simply a piece of magic sent from heaven.   On the first hit, you know that this is sent from the heavens. I have a pretty high tolerance, but the first hit let me know that I was in for a special experience. It starts off with an overwhelmingly strong and stimulating cerebral buzz that quickly spreads to the rest of the body. After smoking about half the blunt, I was on another planet. My mind was racing with thoughts and memories, and every inch of my body was tingling. Sensations were intensified, it was slightly windy outside but every gust of wind washed over me in warm, comforting waves of euphoria. At this point, the head buzz had calmed a bit, but was still very intense. Nature, its sounds and sights were overwhelmingly serene and peaceful. I was totally at peace, as if nothing could harm me. After finishing the blunt, I of course sparked up another one and was shot into another universe. Moving inside, I turned on some music and cranked the volume, leaned back in a comfortable seat and closed my eyes. The music took over. It was breathtaking, one of the most wonderful experiences I've ever had. The euphoria was very strong, encompassing my head with a serene happiness and washing over every inch of my body. I felt heavy and glued to the seat, as if I couldn't move and I never wanted to. Did I mention the music? It sent me into worlds of my own thought and memory, lost in blissful joy. The intensity of this strain was simply unbelievable. After the peak ended after about 45 minutes, I was still very noticeably high for well over two hours. A subtle head high remained while the body effects tapered down to where I was easily productive, but still high.   The come down, however, was a horrible experience. I can't really blame this on the strain as it could just be my own personal experience, but I felt I should mention it. I had very intense pressure behind the eyes and had a pretty bad depressive episode. I have these fairly regularly, it's one of the reasons I smoke, but never had I experienced one this bad while on the come down from a very happy, euphoric strain (my favorite kind). Like I said, this could just be me but I felt it deserved mentioning. I am definitely not turned off from this strain, because again it could have just been a one time thing and the extremely positive effects of this strain simply cannot be denied because it's one I'll remember for a long time.",4,ak-47
RoastedToastedJo,"AK-47 is a sneaky little guy. I have the MediX cartridge for my vape pen and it only took 2 hits before I was feeling it.   A Good Social Strain  The high started off very mellow, the more I smoked the more at ease yet, alert and aware I was feeling. I puffed on the pen all night with my friends and woke up the next morning brushing off some drowsiness that lingered after the high wore off, everything was good.  However, when I first smoked this alone, I became so aware of my surroundings that I got a little paranoid and it will give you the munchies, you've been warned.  All around I'd say that AK-47 is a pretty decent strain. Being that it is a Sativa-Dominant hybrid, I'd recommend this for daytime use or at night in a social setting, only because of the drowsy after-high.",4,ak-47

Warning to you guys who also purchase DVs, do NOT excessively exhale through your nose or it will hurt for a minute or so afterwards. Also, apparently there were lab results posted finding traces of PESTICIDES on the OUTSIDE of the Cartridge? I donâ€™t know how old the claims are or if they are legit but just be educated friends.

Now maybe it was just me but I noticed a few particulars about this strain. To me it seemed that the cooler the smoke the sweeter more Woody the taste. It has a pretty good clear headed high, though the cooler the more relaxing it seemed to get.

But it's quite creative after a little while.   Complex high that evolves over time. Well recommended, if only it didn't smell terrible...",4,ak-47

SÃ© que creciÃ_ mediante &quot;supercropping&quot; con el fin de aprovechar la poca potencia de luz que tenÃ_a disponible y funcionÃ_ de maravilla. Creciendo firme y bonita como un bonsai, entregÃ_ una cosecha que fue bastante abundante en comparaciÃ_n a las cepas que la acompaÃ±aban. Ahora que va terminando su segundo mes de curado tiene un aroma cÃ_trico y un poco dulsÃ_n, suave al fumar, con una subida que para mÃ_, llega a su pic rÃ¡pidamente, manteniÃ©ndose en un nivel sÃ_lido que se mantiene en el tiempo. AcompaÃ±ado de una leve sensaciÃ_n corporal de relajo, se hace perfecto para conversar con amigos, escuchar mÃºsica y tomar una cerveza con posibilidades de idear un nuevo plan.

soraw,Lovely strain this. Smoke this one a few times each time depending on the mood but it give different effect. Mostly energetic and happy buzz. Sometime after smoking for 20 minutes you might feel couch-lock or sleepy though. Best to smoke with friend as the high is very instant and very clear so it is easy to smoke and do activity. Love the sativa! ,4,ak-47
Scootzee,"This strain is very potent and leaves you surprisingly lit after just a few bowls in a vaporizer. After vaping this bud for the first time last night, I had a great time, I was very relaxed but not lethargic or more tired than I should be, I was very uplifted and extremely focused, music was fun to listen to as well. Beware though, this bud will take you too another planet if you aren't careful, at this point, as with most strains, you will lose the focused and energetic effect and enter a more psychoactive and &quot;couch-locked&quot; state (which is very fun I might add). I would definitely recommend vaping this bud or any bud for that matter simply because the flavor of this tree is absolutely delicious, not to mention vaping is healthier for you and it is a clearer high. The taste is strong and very piny, with heavy citrus/lemony undertones. I did not experience the skunk flavor at all. AK-47 is an outstanding strain. 4/5",4,ak-47

ChillWizard,"This strain seems to have the dual ability to (on the same dosage) to either give me a solid well grounded, well balanced, but strong high that I'm in control of, or a head spinning high where most stuff makes no sense and you're just barely hanging on to the outward appearance of normalcy. Some nights I would use it as a nightcap to gently ease into bedtime after smoking another strain earlier in the evening, and sometimes the order was reversed.  Either way it's a powerful strain that even when it's being gnarly it won't completely derail your experience (if you're prone to anxiety like me). ",4,ak-47

Itâ€™s right in between and I love it. ",4,ak-47

Itâ€™s great for going to work or just hanging out at home. This strain devours stress and anxiety. Itâ€™s a smooth smoke. Itâ€™s great for rolling big fat joints . I smoke the whole thing because its so relaxing and clear headed. I just got seeds so Iâ€™m going to grow it soon. I think itâ€™s great for getting chaotic thoughts smoothed out into clear thinking. My wife and I are able to have deep meaningful conversations and realizations when we smoke AK-47. I think it helps to open up to higher realms of consciousness. If your looking for something heavy and stoney this is not for you, if your looking for something light, smooth and refreshing AK is perfect. ",5,ak-47

I'm honestly usually not a fan of sativas or sativa dominant hybrids because of severe anxiety issues, but sometimes I find one that helps ease that tension instead of stoking the flames, this is one of those times. I'd say the green hit tastes slightly earthy/sour with some nice floral hints on the retro. Nice slightly uplifted at first. Seems to make me focused yet relaxed. It does seem to have a kinda steep sleepy come down that culminates in a munch fest if I overindulge during a session, but never have I experienced any anxiety with this strain.",4,ak-47

highlyscientific,"Pleasant, gentle puff. Not at all like a barrage of bullets. No coughing. Smooth. Mild mannered on the tongue. 2 hits for Martini61. Calamity Jane (or Annie-Got-Her-AK-47) took three. She will henceforth be referred to as CJ. Old Man Blathers is also making a cameo in this review.  â€œHow would you describe the high?â€ù asked Martini61.  CJ fans her fingers in front of her face, peeping from behind. 1, 2, 3 fingers wave before her eyes.  â€œOoooh,â€ù says Martini61. â€œShy but playful finger moving and cute eye widening.â€ù  CJ is slammed. The other two seem to be having a more gradual ascent. OMB saw it more as an approach rather than an ascent.  Martini61: happy, giggling, gentle high.  CJ: (a series of facial expressions, from the happy to the confused to the  bilateral)  Creativity MIGHT be good; but implementation, verbalization, and delivery of service - a term that makes CJ barf in her mind - are all way down. So is creativity increase? Does creativity exist in that realm?  Philosophical thought inclined; but, once again, implementation and verbalization is way down.   Conversation is impaired. We are certainly under the impression that we are saying things to each other and we know well enough to wait while others were talking. But there is no rhyme nor reason. 20 minutes later, we prolonged period of coherent communication. Communication revived.  Down a level. OMB says heâ€™s more stoned whereas before he was more high.   Stoned: Increased eyelid weight.  High: Racing brain.  Indica vs. Sativa, we discovered.    Martini61 is desperate to know if sheâ€™s the only one - and Calamity Jane - who donâ€™t know the difference between high and stoned. So Old Man Blathers reaches out for a lineline: He texts college friend Dave Useda, who replied, â€œScadush...vs. Vienna Boysâ€™ Choir going, â€˜Aaaaaaah!â€™â€ù  When asked to define â€˜scadush,â€™ Useda replies, â€œSca...dush...slo mo crashing into bed.â€ù",4,ak-47

I was dabbing through out the day with another friend and once I smoked this on top of the dabs, I felt like I was walking on clouds, it left me in a state of euphoria and giddiness. I also noticed a subtle body high which I thoroughly enjoyed. Also, after smoking this strain I ate a full pizza, frozen yogurt, on top of a lunch before smoking.

Nah I REALLY WAS IN SPACE. I have literally never been this fucking high before!!!! I was going in &amp; out of it while I was otp with my girl at night and we argued whether I was falling asleep or not lmfaoooo.

It definitely lifted my mood and spirts nicely,  and then slowly tapered into a deep sence of comfort to where I was able to fall asleep FINALLY without the help of any other kind of sedation!! Since my daughter passed almost 10 years ago I haven't been able to sleep without some kind of help from either being prescribed something from the doctor, or buying some kind of sedative over the counter!!!

Candycane79,One of my top favorite strains. High is chill and relaxed but still want to get stuff done and can do so with a clear focused head. Just makes me feel happy even while doing household chores. Helps with the pain and nausea too! Highly recommend this strain,5,ak-47
Jasimbeg,Very good weed not different from anything pretty earth and exciting.,4,ak-47
netrubicon,"Well balanced and happy smoke. I get butterflies in my stomach when I smoke it and how can you not feel better like that all day?  Nice for body aches and headaches. I could smoke this every day.  Its a great smoke to take with you in the outdoors, hiking, fishing,  work. Really keeps my body at peace.",5,ak-47
Xenolightyear8900,This strain is awesome! Hands down absolutely the best strain I have ever had. I love how it makes everything look like a music video. And I can see that the colors of objects look 3D enhanced. Itâ€™s just awesome. In fact thatâ€™s why I bought more. _Ÿ˜__Ÿ_ˆâù_ï¸è,5,ak-47
GreenGreenWA,"Yo peeps, The Grower has everything to do with the flower. Methods, time taking care of the product, How long flowering is, curing correctly,trimming,etc..AK is sativa dominant..but just because the genes are sativa doesn't mean you'll get sativa effects...if your source let her flower longer she'll have more indica like effects...My AK is sour, skunky and generally isn't ready until early October here in the PNW....She's bushy, turns radiant hues of maroon,red,purple,yellow..quite a spectacle. I harvest when the trichomes are milky white mainly with a hint of amber. Everyone who's had this gives positive feedback and how content they felt...focused,anxiety free, creative, and relaxed but not to the point of CL unless you're just puffing nonstop...any strain will produce CL...hell Durban P will produce CL if you smoke enough...A well done AK 47 is a serene experience",5,ak-47
AumjayKistrya,"Very good, did smoke it in a joint, not from a dispensary where the regulated stuff is.... Different. A bit of cotton mouth, but had a fun epileptic like session. Hard to use a computer when shaking your head as fast as you can and all.",5,ak-47
Bskelton0907,growing this beauty as I type..about 2 weeks out before I harvest and the buds are so dense and sticky its unbelievable..I reccomended this strain for any first time grower or experienced grower ,5,ak-47
Qkat22,NIIIIICE!!  A strong high that lasts.,5,ak-47
ManRay,"This is some nice looking wax from Chronic Creations, it's got a nice gold sheen and good transparency. The taste of this shatter consists mainly of tropical fruits reminiscent of mango and pineapple. This is a nice strain for those who want heavy head effects but something that isn't too stimulating or anxiety prone. This is quickly becoming one of my favorite strains, it leaves me relaxed and giggly but also extremely lucid. The name of this strain is the antithesis to how it makes you feel. I think this strain is one of the classics for a good reason; I give it a hearty recommend.",5,ak-47
Bombpussy,Very good for night of you have snacks beside you,4,ak-47
riced1980,"Came across this strain while I was working on the road in Wine Country New York, the Finger Lakes region. Love that area anyhow, I met an old hippie who ended up being my connect and the first couple times I bought from him, he had AK47. Nice buzz.",4,ak-47
NJMMPreviews,"Focused and potent.   I use it as a morning strain or a strain for playing music and creating. Itâ€™s more of an â€œanytimeâ€ù strain for me but itâ€™s energetic enough to make it to my morning rotation.   Do be careful as itâ€™s a strong strain so, too much will have you snoozing even if itâ€™s an upbeat cultivar.   Taste is a little cheesy and earthy but overall, pretty mild flavor. ",5,ak-47
Greenlion42,"Just took a few draws from my pen and this is no disappointment. It delivers the perfect head high that keeps you slightly euphoric. I had used this yesterday morning when I needed a pick me up and it did the job. This is better used as a day strain. Good strain to vape little peppery on the throat, but still a good match!",5,ak-47
Codyloc915,"This is a great strain for depression, pain, and sleep! This is the all around good feeling flower that can be used during the day and can also be used to put you to sleep at night. The only minor  negatives is dry mouth and dry eyes. Have your favorite Arizona tea with you to fix that problem and have yourself a great day with this strain! ",5,ak-47
Joshy86,pretty good,5,ak-47
jonathanbford216,"named this one after a deadly rifle for a reason. a classic remedy I'm always excited to come across, also one of my favorites. I would probably would choose this over a lot of other strains out there. AK is always a lovely treat.",5,ak-47
FischerGenetics,Grows as advertised! Thank you Serious Seeds!,5,ak-47
KASHA24,love it,5,ak-47
TheBluntBodkin,"Hapy and Relaxed, should be enjoyed in nature. ",5,ak-47
SpaceGhost28,"I was expecting a stronger sativa experience from this strain, as my dispensary claimed, but it felt closer to a 60/40 or 50/50. That being said, it's one of the most beautiful strains I've seen with all of the orange threads. The effects kind of reminds me of Girl Scout Cookies, but it doesn't taste as good. Anyway, no complaints. I like it. Too bad Breakwater is over an hour away.",5,ak-47
aliendwin,"AK47 has a very bright, heady high, while not being too intense to handle socially. its also a nice little motivator; giving you a burst of inspiration to practice your craft, go for a walk, or cook yourself dinner. it tends to make me a little bit drowsy when the high tapers down. ",4,ak-47
thetruebagels,"When I first came into contact with this strain it did its job and it did it well. I felt a little spacy, euphoric and overall &quot;well-minded&quot;.  However, I did become pretty accustomed it the effects and it slowly &quot;lost its potency&quot; for me. I would definitely give it another shot but maybe after a break just to see. I have had the same experience with other strains before so I usually buy more than one at a time. This time I didn't and I wish I did.",3,ak-47
AlteredFrequency,"This strain is great for get up &amp; go on low energy days, bulletproof to grow and high yielding. It's a beautifully smooth smoke. However, I wouldn't recommend it for those with anxiety as in high doses it's prone to stir up anxiety and paranoia in susceptible people, something I've noticed in myself and friends - YMMV.",3,ak-47
JonJohnPhenomenon,"Rata-Tat-Tat. All Rifles Matter! Do not fear this strain for it is not a menace. Come hither, embrace, &amp; envelope this heady hybrid. Closer to a sativa with the headiness that ensues, it hits within 3 minutes and makes u feel like you had a list of To-Do's today that you must get done, however you need not write anything down bc this beast of a brain (with help from AK) has it all organized and filed away in chronological synchronicity. need to take care of errands - try this strain. need to create a list of errands to take care of try this strain. need to wind down for bedtime..maybe skip this strain. enjoy. the Phenomenon has begun",4,ak-47
MentalNote,"I got this in 93.62% concentrate, cartridge...... has a nice hybrid effect going. Helps with my pain while also keeping me motivated to....in my case work on music. Kinda has a fruity but pepper like flavor..... gives me that sinus burn (which is a good thing). Always heard about this strain and so very glad i've finally had the pleasure.",5,ak-47
FuzzwooWolf,"I took a toke of AK-47 for the first time last year in the summer after my best friend recommended it to me.  AK-47 is a smooth, flavorful, and has a powerful hit when the high kicks in. The strain left me feeling very calm, relaxed, and without anxiety/stress.  It definitely has climbed to number 16 of 20 in my top 20 favorite strains, and I always be sure to grab at least a quarter, or two pre-rolls whenever I visit a dispensary that has the flower/bud in stock.  No joke, AK-47 will shoot you to a whole new level of high",5,ak-47
EV117S,Definitely a stress and anxiety reliever. Does not affect alertness,5,ak-47
Jamezque,Got me into hours straight of records and YouTube stand up,4,ak-47
Hasskilzzz,My last and current grow is ak-47. Its a beautiful plant pretty easy grow. The smell and taste are amazing. Fruity earthy some of the best tasting/smelling flower ive grown.  The high is very mellow and creative. I do like its offspring better as a grow and yield ak-48.,4,ak-47
Blau74,"As someone else said in a review, what you think weed smells like, tastes like and gets you high like.. becomes the bomb when you salad mix it with Northern Lights, my favourite combo so far, someone please hybrid these two.",5,ak-47
JazzyBeats,Music is the best! my truck has big subs and I've been listening to really bassy music for like 2 hours.. if you like music alot this is a strain for you!,5,ak-47
PKs_Kush,Awesome to help focus,4,ak-47
georgiarrobinson,"Great for during the day, productive type highs. If youâ€™re trying to mellow out and relax, would not recommend! Gave me slight anxiety and manic symptoms. Very potent! Take it easier with this one!",4,ak-47
freeasabird8317,"CONSISTENT. I've bought this strain a few times in a few different places, a couple of different states, and each time it's been the exact same incredible experience. It's easy as hell to grow, you can depend on it being the real Ak-47 just about everywhere you go. My high experience: euphoric and happy as FUCK. alot of positive thoughts but greatest of all, mental breakthroughs. I smoke to heal my mind, heart and soul, and I promise you, this strain is excellent for meditation and positive deep introspection. everything becomes sensitive, senses are wide open. very relaxing but mentally uplifting high. this is a staple in my stash.

Bdrizzle23,Two hits for good head high.,4,ak-47
ToastedMainer,"Because of it's 4 way lineage, AK-47 makes a great universal weed. Well- rounded buzz, looks and tastes great. ",5,ak-47
wickedcliche,"this is amazing for a perfect relaxing, creative, tasty sativa dominant hybrid. i love it",5,ak-47
KylerHasAids,Has a very unique taste. When they say it has a â€œfloralâ€ù taste I think thatâ€™s the perfect definition. ,4,ak-47
tevin420s,Feels like a more indica but itâ€™s a decent hybrid,4,ak-47
AMMGK,The indica part of the AK -47 strain hit me a little bit too hard. Got very anxious and paranoid. Would not recommend these while being around people or just on daily basis.,3,ak-47
MESH_MIESTER,Is nice,4,ak-47
Kieara62,Not a fan. Couldnâ€™t get past the taste of burnt flowers and dirty diapers. ,2,ak-47
Mothertoker,"I take a couple hits before hittinâ€™ the misses at home... well I tell you what, this stuff will make you feel like a pornstar... Iâ€™ve done shit in bed Iâ€™d be ashamed to mention to my friends.  Needless to say, itâ€™s a creative intense buzz.",4,ak-47
Iammanus420,I love the smell of this strain burning in the air attracted me to smoke it. It has a nice terps and balance of cannabinoids its potent and long last effects make it one of my favorites.,5,ak-47
AK47AFGHANAAK47,Tastes and smells like pure honey. Does keep you buzzed due to Sativa however the Afghans effect hits like a sledgehammer. ,5,ak-47
UncannyGuitar,"AK is weed. It's the weediest weed. It smells like you'd expect weed to smell, tastes like you'd expect weed to taste, and gives you a stereotypical giggling high. While there are more interesting options, you can't go wrong with some quality AK",4,ak-47
Mr_M,i really didn't like this strain. It gave me really bad muscle cramps and tensed me up,2,ak-47
Purplepuffs,I made cookies with this and it helped my pain and make me feel calm. ive also smoked it and it a nice earthy but mild with a kick tast. It helps with my anxity.,5,ak-47

OttomanViking,"It gives a good body high, makes you relaxed and gives you a good night rest.",3,ak-47
Torilovexx,My only negative is that this strain gave me a headache. Besides that it was a fun high for hanging out with friends and playing video or board games ,4,ak-47
Cryrste,Very little smell or flavor - which can be a good thing sometimes. Takes about 3-4 bowls to really get blazed. Itâ€™s mostly a head high. ,3,ak-47
VictoriaJasmine97,This is my go to for most of my medical problems :) super useful and works relatively fast for me. ,5,ak-47
TPlay1235,"Excellent for a good gaming session, listening to music , but makes me dozey for reading. Mixed with Warlock , good all around trip.",5,ak-47
witchfinder,Old school great taste one of a kind,5,ak-47
Cyber-Dakini,"Great high for after work, or short occasion. Smells like cheese. Best part is the high lasts like 2-3 hours, then fades. Kinda like having a beer in that regard. Super mellow.",5,ak-47
Ari-,"Provides a near-instant high thru my bong that I love, but gives me the worst dry mouth of any strain I've ever smoked. I smoked a few bowls one night and drank an entire 2 liter. An upside of this strain is that I can remain pretty lucid during it, though.",4,ak-47
Jugg4lo,I remember this was by far the STICKIEST bud I've EVER cime across. We literally stuck a small bud to the wall. Never fell. Ended up having to peel it off.,5,ak-47

natalieannm1986,Good. ,4,ak-47
missbaltimore,"Light to medium green colored buds with prominent orange hairs throughout. Earthy and spicy smell, heavy spice/pepper taste. Medium to long after taste in mouth. I liked it but I feel like itâ€™s just a popular strain, and other ones are more suited for me.",3,ak-47
sayword3,"The strain, Ak-47 is decent. I don't really care for it though. Euphoric, happy, energetic, uplifted, talkative, dizzy, slightly anxious for the first 10-20 minutes. Then relaxed and slightly happy. Come down can be accompanied with a headache. Moderate munchies can come on after an hour. Bright neon green and dark green nugs with moderate amount of clear and cloudy trich. Thick to thin light brown hairs sprawl out. Aroma is citrus, hops, skunk and hints of pine. Taste is like pine-sol. Smoke is moderately light. Decent cough that's some what short. I don't recommend ak-47.",2,ak-47
Ricoink,Didnâ€™t think the strain was any good at all. It got me most irratated that the high isnâ€™t as good as I thought would never smoke it again,1,ak-47
