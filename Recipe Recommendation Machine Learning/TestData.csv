0,CannabisKook,"Friends, stoners, red-eyed countrymen, lend me your ears; for I bring unto thee a tale of the Blue Dream...  Tâ€™was a calm April night, 2014 it was, and I had eagerly purchased an eighth of some pungent Blue Dream. Itâ€™s abundance of sugary trichomes, paired with the thick density of the bud was enough to bring a tear to your eye. I enthusiastically ground up the cheeba, packed a generous bowl and went to town. Eight minutes and a bowl later, I was beginning to assume that my herb wasnâ€™t all that strongâ€_but then it hit me like a 150-ton locomotive of euphoria.  â€œWhoooaâ€ù was the only thing that I could say, as I looked at everything around the living room. Everything looked as if it were lagging behind by a few frames, and this cerebral adventure lasted for the first few minutesâ€_but just when I thought that Blue Dream had shown me everything there was to experience about her, her sativa effects began to kick in.  All of a sudden, I felt as if I was briskly cruising on a warm cloud, which was followed by an amazing burst of energy. Folks let me tell you, if youâ€™d ever like to find out how an eagle feels when it spreads its majestic wings and takes to the air at 80 mph., this strain is a kickass tool to take you there. Finally, when all of your euphoric energy has been expended, Blue Dream ends her experience with a mellow cruise induced by her indica side.  Call in at Jimmy Johnâ€™s and order 12 sandwiches, fire up Netflix, and take it easy on the couch until you slowly begin to melt into the furniture, because you're going to start to drift off into your happy place; and as soon as you reach that critical point of relaxation, youâ€™re going to sleep like a sloth on twelve doses of Ambien.  Folks, I guess the moral of the story here is that Blue Dream is an outstanding and pleasurable strain that is fun for cannabis enthusiasts anywhere on the experience spectrum; from the novice user who is looking to have an easy-going yet memorable experience, to the seasoned smoker who owns a laser pointer and a cat, and anybody in between; but my review alone canâ€™t depict the exquisite effects that Blue Dream has to offer. Roll up a liberal amount of Blue Dream, spark it up, and let her take you on a spectacular trip; youâ€™ll be thankful you did when your mind is blissfully floating through the heavens.",5,blue-dream,0.15268817204301072,0.48924731182795694,True,False,False,0.2862514847268811,0.0032218850323931887,0.8332623357243888,0.1861067113060404,0.9801197103806666,158,False,0.7202396771219489,0.08951574137025314,False,True,muscle_spasms,False

I have complex ptds from 25 years of emotional abuse from my mother and neglect from my father. and i felt more relaxed and compassionate about myself any every other person and i knew i had that in there. recomended for anyone that has extreme emotions disturbances about things that happend during your life. not recomended for medical conditions such pchizophrenia obsessive compulsive disorder bi-polasr disorder or anything along thouse lines. not depression though, it eased my depression which had readched a level were i was on suicide watch for 3 years. this strain made my happier and have a more controlled perspective on life while enjoying myself than any other strain ever. deffinately by far my favorite",5,blue-dream,0.18557971014492758,0.5999275362318841,True,False,False,0.2862514847268811,0.0032218850323931887,0.8332623357243888,0.1861067113060404,0.9801197103806666,34,True,0.7294912843805732,0.1827018638103802,False,True,cramps,True

3,surfzen88,"So many have reviewed this strain, but I'll add my two cents for medical patients like myself. Blue Dream is Numero Uno. It is the best! Blue Dream is everything I've wanted out of my medical cannabis experience. I'm a sensitive type and I don't like to be high. I have migraines and anxiety for which I want to reduce prescription medication use. BD has allowed me to do that. Honestly, before Blue Dream, I had just about given up on cannabis as medicine because I'd had too many bad experiences from even tiny amounts. To me BD feels like taking a Xanax. It's just mildly-sedating without being panic inducing, and when I vape at the sign of a migraine, it will take it away. Sometimes it takes a few hours, but it almost always works (when it doesn't work, I bring out a bigger gun like Purple Arrow). BD made me realize that clear hybrids might be the best choice to deal with my issues and I've focused on them ever since. Note that the grower makes a huge difference (as always). First time I had it was from a very reputable grower but I guess it was a bad batch because I got no benefit from it. Later i saw Phat Panda had some BD (I've always experienced great product from them) and I tried it - totally different positive experience.

5,StukaFox,"Not too many people know this, but back during the Stone Age cavemen had hella kind buds! The stuff grew everywhere and it was really potent because it was fertilized   with dinosaur poop. See, they used to feed a Brontosaurus bean and cheese burritos until it was stuffed, then they ran like hell before the deluge hit. The problem    was they only had one pipe and they lost it at a King Crimson concert and smoking out of an apple was way too ghetto. So despite all that great weed, Neanderthal Man   never got to take a giant sucking tornado hit of Caveman Kush. One day, after years of looking fruitlessly for an aluminum can, they all just said 'fuck it' and   died. That's what happened to Neanderthal Man. They never tell you this kinda shit at the museum, but you know how -I- know? Blue Dream. I took a big ol' leather-  lungs hit of Blue Dream and all that stuff came to me like the revealed truth. I also discovered Fritos are yummy and Kyuss is stony. That's THREE Nobel-Level   discoveries off one hit of Blue Dream.

17,JboneAK,"Recently I've come to grips with having a frustratingly high tolerance, some times struggling to get high. I was no match for Blue Dream. I'm going to attempt to consume and write this, so perhaps the quality of the review is the review itself. See. I'm zoning already.   Visual: Straight off it looks very sativa, with its long hair and slender sexy features. Super sugary and quite sticky when busted open. Well manicured, so tops for aesthetics.   Smell: Opening the bag, it smells like a stinky spicy cheese. Busted the nug and it was super pungent diesel inside. Dank scent for sure.   Now I busted the nug in half and ground it up in my Kannastor and got some super gritty sticky bong load. Loaded a solid pinch in the bowl and lit it with hemp wick. It burned quick and evenly, and had my Silika beaker opaque in about a half second.   Pulled the slide and cleared it. I wasn't ready. I'm looking at my notes now and I very sloppily wrote &quot;holy shit.&quot; I stand by that. Stoned, stunned, stupid. Thick, billowy, diesel flavored clouds of smoke, not too scratchy on holding it in and forgivable on exhale. About five minutes later great euphoria and relaxation dragged it's nails down my back, I just want to sit down, can't cause I got bong rips to do. Next thing I know I'm feeling pumped, focused. Taking notes for science now. Ten minutes since first rip and my arms are heavy as shit, and I'm standing so and can't just lay em on the couch. Gonna have to carry em. Slammed two more bowls. I'm stoned and I'm sitting down.   Blue Dream is definitely going to be a regular for me.

19,vengeurban,"this bud will have you soaring! I've been smoking regularly for 1 year now and when I got this bud I didn't know what strain it was so I loaded my bong bowl FAT. Blue dream is really kiefy so I put a bunch of kief on top of my already bulging bowl. smoking a bowl of &quot;regular&quot; loaded as fat as this one will get me pretty damn high so I thought nothing of it. The smoke was a wee bit harsh and near the end of the bowl I started coughing more frequently. as soon as the bowl was finished I could no longer gauge time accurately and a sense of euphoria came over me. I knew at this point that I was going to be REALLY high for a pretty good amount of time. I laid down on my bed with my chest up and my arms spread out and euphoria just began to wash over me. my body was completely relaxed and my heart rate began to pick up. I've never had good eyesight but now my eyesight was crystal clear. colors seemed richer and the light from the sun shining through my window was just transcendent. since then I've had a lot of spiritual experiences after smoking this bud. this high really lifts my spirits and even long after the obvious effects of being high are no longer felt, the happiness, energy, and a sliver of euphoria are still there.

Awesome for mid-day or evening use but not bad for morning either in smaller amounts.  Smells of sweet blueberries with herbal undertones.  Most nugs are big, fluffy, and conical.

This is a common but classic strain with strong medicinal and spiritual properties. Recently I've been getting buds with a rich rosey lemon phenotype. It really is one of the most delightful weed scents that I've ever smelled.  Blue Dream is very relaxing and provides an uplifted almost philosophical high. I started pairing this bud with my yoga not too long ago and it really helps to deepen my practice and mind-body connection. Meditation and Blue Dream go hand in hand as well. The reason I'm giving this only 4 stars instead of 5 is because this has a very high THC content and can be very strong, catching you by surprise at times. I've gotten paranoid a few times and in higher doses you can really feel the Haze which isn't always conducive to focusing and getting lots of work done.

You remain clear-headed the whole time, interesting, your field of vision gets a haze like a dream, maybe that's why they call it Blue Dream? It has haze parent so maybe the name haze is because it does give a haze!  The flavor and smell is really blueberry, very nice!  You feel gentle, cute and dreamy like a baby, not really much Sativa energetic feel to it, really, I guess it's sativa influence is only good enough to get you through the day. Very mellow and manageable no matter how much you smoke, def. for newbies.  Good for: Nature, listening to music, anxiety/stress relief, long walks.  What it lacks: It has no energetic, euphoric, speedy, giggly sativa effects.  It doesn't make you horny.  It doesn't give the munchies.  Not an aid for socializing as you feel delicate, gentle, baby like.  Not very introspective.  Didn't make me laugh although many people say it does.

75,carlsagan,"There is a reason they call it &quot;Blue Dream&quot;, it will have you feeling like you are on cloud nine dreaming with a very sweet tasteful flavor. Blasting you into space, it will catch you by surprise as it envelopes your body  onto a orbital floater device.    Now what I am saying is the classic sativa high without the anxiety is finally here and this portal device is what we call 'Blue Dream'.    The genetics are known as DJ Short's Blueberry crossed with Santa Cruz Haze (Super Silver Haze [phenotype strain] grown in Santa Cruz). It is a legendary clone only strain, only sold as a clone in various dispensaries / clubs and caregivers.    This plant is truly an ultimate value long lasting medicinal effect medication. It can help ease pain with a very strong body high, and it lacks lethargy (fatigue), however it relaxs you aka &quot;chills you out&quot;.    But aswell keeps you awake due to the haze genetics, however you may find yourself able to control the experience if your mind wanders off or not, it is just like &quot;dreaming&quot;. You are in control of the psychoactive effects.  It's a great strain to &quot;Chill out up in the clouds&quot;. But as said early provide strong pain relief.    Most landrace sativas lack a strong body high, and some landrace strains tend to be extremely racy in psychoactive effects, that the average medicinal user may experience Anxiety and or Panic Attacks aswell as intense Paranoia, can be easily mistaken for a &quot;psychotic episode&quot; or schizophrenia.    The landrace sativas should be taken with caution regarding doseage, just as the herb plant may seem light and fluffy, doesn't mean the THC ratio can't pack a surprise. The CBD (cannabinidiol) and other Cannabinoids in the hybrid strains help &quot;level out&quot; the experience.    In that saying Blue Dream is a wonderful hybrid strain with strong sativa dominance but lacking the negatives of the sativa pheno and indica phenos of the Cannabis Sativa plant.    Sativa without the &quot;mental exhaustion&quot; and &quot;psychotic episodes&quot;.  Thanks to the small bits of genetic indica code in both phenotypes, it allows the plant to have CBD to level out any anxiety that may be onset from the Sativa chemical compounds.    if you wish to experience a sativa experience without the negative side effects brought on by landrace sativas, give Blue Dream a chance, newbies beware if you take a large dose.  You will be in for a new plateua of being medicated.    For veterans: You will enjoy this strain in hash form.  For vape users: This strain is a must to try in your collection.  For newbies: Try taking smaller doses of this to get a feel for the sativa and how it effects your experience while under the effects.    Just as anybody says pace yourself when trying new phenotypes.

76,crc711,"Blue dream is close to the best strain that I have found for my needs. For depression it is a great strain. It has a nice smooth uplift, with a steady mild euphoria within minutes.      â€¢ Itâ€™s also helpful with anxiety as it allows me to think a bit clearer, and calmer. It helps calm racing thoughts, but doesnâ€™t limit your creativity.   â€¢ A great daytime or nighttime use strain. Wonderful for a mid-day slump to get you back in gear. Also perfect for relaxing at the end of the day.   The taste is amazing, nice flavor with a smooth hit.  Batch info: Curio Wellness in Maryland  (Dispensed by RevolutionReleaf),    [ THCa ]: 23.8%    [ Cbd ] : 0%  --&gt; This stain is high in Terpenes, specifically Myrcene, Pinene, Terpinolene (10.2 mg/g!), Nerolidol, Ocimene, linalool, B-Pinene.      The terpenes in Blue Dream seem to have a nice counter effect to any negative thc effects and give a calmer experience. Generally for myself with thca, anything over 22-23 percent tends to eventually bring on some level of mild anxiety (tighter jaw and a stimulated feeling), but certainly NOT this strain, thanks to its expansive terpene profile. I have found it to be relaxing.      Throughout my experience with Blue Dream, I have found the effects are fast and very effective. I have Depression, Anxiety, and Adhd, so when I find a strain that treats/helps all three simultaneously, like this does, itâ€™s awesome.   Itâ€™s a top-shelf-medical strain that I recommend to beginners and more experienced individuals. I personally have not found a much better strain for depression and panic attacks. Again, highly recommended. If you get a chance to try this please do, and enjoy!

Focus with none of the side effects from drugs like Adderall.    It lifted my mood, gave me more energy, relaxed me and caused my depression to pack up it's bags and leave.  More than just not being depressed, I actually feel happy and find life enjoyable even when I'm chronically ill every day, all of this while leaving my sex organs completely functional unlike typical antidepressants (SSRI's).  I found it gave me dry eyes but the dry mouth wasn't bad at all.  No real overwhelming munchies or anxiety, if anything it helped my anxiety, especially my social anxiety and made socializing easier.  It helped a decent amount with my chronic pain as well at lower doses and at higher doses your whole body goes numb to a degree, and pain in your head and the rest of your body is just so much easier to deal with.  At higher doses this strain really helps my asthma as well when vaped, I don't think my lungs have ever worked this good before in my life.  Of the 10 strains of weed I've tried so far Blue Dream works the best for my nausea.   I can safely say that without it my illnesses have got so bad that I would probably have to have a feeding tube by now if not for the nausea control that Blue Dream provides as I wouldn't be able to keep any food down.

However, the taste of their cross doesn't impress me. It isn't bad, but it just isn't what I like. It isn't as sweet as the blueberry or as spicy as the haze.

97,photalysis,"Note: I have a low tolerance. Neutral as far as stimulating or sedating effect goes. Not inherently euphoric or dysphoric, either. Aroma is practically non-existent, good for those who need to be discreet. Highly disorienting in the amounts I smoked, where I would hear voices and music inside the kitchen fan. Colors are very bright, far too high to successfully complete any task requiring &quot;linear&quot; or co-ordinated thought, my thoughts become highly introspective and laterally arranged. Some subtle patterns when I close my eyes. Feelings of intense heat and pressure radiate from my chest. Definitely some potential for paranoia. The experience is very much like a daydream. Has a mild indica end-note that is sufficient for maintaining a sleep schedule, but may not be enough to help with insomnia.  Not great for creative thought during the plateau IMO as cognition is chaotic and incoherent. Unless you take care to write down ideas to be digested in a more sober state of mind.  But by far the greatest effects are those experienced after the high has worn off, after about 8 hours of sleep. A very peaceful morning afterglow in which everyday life has more appeal. I am more motivated, focused and inspired. I suspect either a rebound effect, or a residual high that is therapeutic without being debilitating. I've strategically self-medicated in this manner by getting stoned in the evening, and riding out the tail of the high the morning after. Productivity losses from being too high are more than made up. I recommend it to anyone with depression, anxiety or attention problems. It's something a little more than a &quot;recreational&quot; strain.  In the middle of a small t-break, what the weed gives it also takes back when I abstain. A little depressed, irritable and unfocused. Life is harder. I feel like a part of me is missing... Still much more tolerable than SSRI withdrawals. I sincerely believe this strain is a real competitor to traditional antidepressants. The pros far outweigh the cons, which are few compared to, say, Zoloft.",4,blue-dream,0.15580498866213155,0.5468480725623582,True,False,False,0.2862514847268811,0.0032218850323931887,0.8332623357243888,0.1861067113060404,0.9801197103806666,3,True,0.06834458019434275,0.01440866210881846,False,True,eye_pressure,False

99,ccstevek,"I got  blue dream fresh from the grow. I use cannabis for the relief of anxiety and insomnia  and it most certainly worked well for both. However, this is SERIOUSLY STRONG medicine.  I would only recommend using this when on the couch or right before bedtime. I slept for many hours without waking up, but still felt the effect ten to twelve hours later. For me I prefer my cannabis to have a lower THC level than this strain. However, for those with severe pain issues or who have a high tolerance, this is highly recommended. It has a nice balance of Sativa and Indica. Even though it is Sativa dominant it does not make you anxious, unless feeling the effects of strong medicine will make you uncomfortable.

And i was like, okay there is no going back by this point, so within like 4 minutes or a little less i felt amazing! i was diagnosed with severe eczema when I was 4 years old, and depression anxiety, that would cause my eczema to flare up and it would be inching and i would scratch because it was extremely itchy, I've tried cream's and certain body washes, and it somewhat helped for a little while, then it started itching really bad again then finally i went to a doctor they gave me some more creams that were &quot;stronger&quot; but it was the same as the other creams I've used, then ever since I started smoking cannabis I've haven't had anxiety depression and my eczema in 6 years, now I'm gonna stick to cannabis and only cannabis, it's crazy that this miracle plant can help so much and of course you gotta have some Blue dream.

104,MsMoon,"REVIEW FOR BLUE DREAM CBD  Iâ€™m leaving this review here because there is no separate listing for CBD. If the regular strain of BD makes you anxious/paranoid but you otherwise enjoy it, the CBD strain may work better for you.  I have been vaping and microdosing this strain as an oil throughout the day. Great for mood, pain and motivation. Typically, it is challenging for me to motivate to leave the house or do even basic household chores. Blue Dream CBD gives me a lift, helps sharpen mental focus and leaves me relaxed. I donâ€™t like to be high in public and this strain lifts me without making me anxious or paranoid when used sparingly. Iâ€™m even able to work using this strain.

As a regular smoker, I rolled a joint and burned it down while playing Skyrim and didn't think much until I started sweating and hearing my name in the game. I turned the system off thinking I had just gotten overwhelmed, but I continued to get up and try and make some lunch. As soon as I stood up, I got dizzy and shaky. I ended up having to sit back down and drink a glass of water while waiting for the attack to go away, which it did after 20 minutes.  You will get fucked up no doubt.

148,scientificstoner,"Fellow stoners,   If you are stumbling upon this strain for the very first time or for the first time in awhile, make sure you have no plans for the rest of the day, and depending on the time of your smoke session, possibly the next morning. It is very strong. From what I remember (lol), my first and/or second hits from my bong were smooth, but I still choked a little. That little bit from those hits was enough to make me very high and giggly.   However, as my week went on and I smoked more of my supply (a couple bong loads a day totaling roughly a gram per day) I started to get affected differently. I would get dizzy and nauseated. I would feel really groggy. I could sleep for over seven hours straight (which is great, donâ€™t get me wrong) but when Iâ€™d wake up, I would have a hangover that lasted throughout the day. This is the type of strain that is so strong when used frequently, that it really should be used in moderation.   What I found works for me is alternating which strain I smoke throughout my day. Right now I smoke cookies and cream during the active portion of my day where I want to remain functioning, and blue dream during the relaxation portion of my day where I want to shut down for deep sleep.   Enjoy, but use with caution!

177,Holly_Hepcat,"Strain: Lucid Blue from Natureâ€™s Medicines  Consumption Method: Vaporized @ 392 degrees  Appearance: 4/5   The nugs are dense, marbled blue-green, and super sugary, with reddish orange to red pistils. Exactly what you would expect from a Blue Dream cut.   Nose: 3/5   The smell is a bit indelicate, with a hard hitting pine on the front end, which on a second sniff mellows to a pithy lemon and the lightest hint of blueberries on the back end.   Flavor: 4/5   Lucid blue packs a big citrus wallop on the front end. Once you get past that hint of bitter pith youâ€™re rewarded with a sweet, tannic blueberry, and a whisper of violets on the exhale. Iâ€™d compare the flavor profile to a good RosÃ¨ wine.   Experience: 3/5   Iâ€™ll be honest, Iâ€™m not a fan of most modern Sativas and Sativa dominant hybrids. They tend to feel speedy and get me lost in my head in a way that strains like Acapulco Gold and Maui Wowie just donâ€™t. With that said, I really enjoy Lucid Blue! Itâ€™s mellow and clear headed, and I can put my thoughts in order.  Iâ€™m fairly convinced that this strain has Headband genetics somewhere in its past, because it gives me that same perfect head pressure Iâ€™ve come to associate with Humbolt county indicas.  On the whole Iâ€™m relaxed, happy, completely out of it pain, and ready to get some work done.  Overall: 3.5/5   Lucid blue is a delicious strain and a great every day smoke but it wonâ€™t exactly having you wax philosophical about the Bigger Luke Theory.   Itâ€™s restoring my faith in modern sativas, but when it comes down to a straight choice, Iâ€™ll pick Acapulco Gold every time.

Blue Dream made it's appearance, and suddenly chemotherapy wasn't so horrific anymore.   Nausea relief without wanting to eat everything in sight? Yup. I could eat, but I didn't have that insane munchies situation other strains gave me. Pain? Dulled to a point where it was hardly noticeable. The relief was nearly instant (vaping), and I actually had a friend who helped me up into my apartment, packed my vape, and helped me smoke, while I was too weak to leave the bathroom. (Literally had to be carried.)   Get relief, feel content, then drift off into sleep if you choose to. You can smoke enough to feel high, but it's a really peaceful high.

188,jack123,"This is a fairly odd strain to review. Its almost like reviewing 3 separate strains at once, because u get 3 very different effects. After smoking u get sativa like effects for about half an hour to 45 minutes. This is the good part of the high (for me at least). After that you &quot;hit a wall&quot; and feel very very tired. Its hard to keep your eyes open. If you are trying to stay productive, this is NOT the strain for you. After waking up, your voice will sound like someone who has smoked 4 packs of cigarettes for the past 60 years... not pretty. Your mouth and throat will feel like the desert as well. Your eyes look like red road maps and you get a &quot;hung over feeling&quot;. I might have gotten a bad batch, because everyone else seems to love it. Its a good strain for about an hour before bed. It was very good for managing pain and anxiety/stress. Also, If you are trying to hide the fact that you are high (from bosses, parents, professors, etc) this probably isn't the strain for you. I love this strain for the first hour, but afterwards it goes downhill.

236,SebadohGPB,"I was at the skatepark and I met someone who bought some blue dream from a dispensary. He rolled me a small joint. Just about enough to finish in about two or three long hits. It tasted fruity and I was on my way to my friends house and I had to walk a good 2 miles to get there. I couldnâ€™t skate because I was too stoned and this was right around the time I was introduced to bud for the first time by one of my friends. So I was pretty baked. The walk felt like it took a lot longer than it should have. I got there and I sat down and the high lingered for the rest of the day. It made me feel very heavy and I felt like people were watching me. Iâ€™ve felt this with other strains but rarely this bad. Once I was in a comfortable situation I felt a lot better. I felt relieved and happy. Like I just completed a journey. This strain made me feel like I was walking with shackles or a heavy backpack from what I can remember. It was unpleasant when I was uncomfortable and I was happy when I was comfortable. But it was an amazing experience to look back on because of the relieve I felt after I got to his house. I would do it again, in the same situation. It added meaning and purpose to the high. The high wasnâ€™t as significant as any of my other times but it was still interesting.

250,Puffaluppagus,"Disclaimer: I'm not usually a sativa smoker, so if you prefer sativas, this review probably won't mean much to you. For curious smokers, be aware that BD is VERY potent stuff--up to 26% THC. It gives you a strong head-heavy feeling, and like most sativas, it's a &quot;cerebral&quot; high. Personally, I prefer indica hybrids, especially high CBD stuff to treat my anxiety disorder, and if you have trouble with anxiety attacks and high-THC strains, I advise you to look elsewhere. BD is a sativa-heavy hybrid that has a delicious aroma and taste (fruity and sweet), but it's not for beginners or nervous types. If you're experienced and have a high tolerance for sativas, BD is just what the doctor ordered.   But if you prefer a mellow body high without your thoughts and heart racing, BD isn't your lady. And like many sativas (at least for me), be prepared for bit of potential headache or dizziness too (sativas can do that sometimes). Friends of mine who love BD feel creative, energized, talkative, and sometimes aren't able to sit still for awhile. They also say it's good for feeling uplifted out of depression and can help stop you from feeling sad (if you can handle sativa's energy).   For me, I need a strain that slows down my thoughts so I can examine them calmly and deal with things that make me feel anxious (without getting a panic attack), as well as cannabis that relaxes my body and eases my daily tension, so stuff like BD isn't really up my alley. If you're like me, and you're looking for a strain that'll melt you into the couch and carry you away on cool clouds of smoke, go with an indica or heavy-indica hybrid and not BD.  Blue Dream is also a ladies' favorite, as many believe this strain is excellent for treating PMS and menstrual cramps (both the mood swings and the pain), as well as providing pain relief for migraines (most migraine sufferers are women).   For a sweet, fruity taste and aroma in something less powerful, I suggest Sweet Pea (about 1-2% THC and 18-20% CBD), Cannatonic, or Critical Cure (both between 3-6% THC and about 15-20% CBD). All three are indica-leaning hybrids that give a relaxing body stone with a healthy dose of CBD to keep things calm and relaxed. If strong weed makes you nervous, do yourself a fave and skip Blue Dream. She's gorgeous and smells amazing, but she's anything but a wilting flower...in fact, she's the cannabis equivalent of a Viking shieldmaiden, strong and powerful and ready to kick your ass if you aren't prepared  ;)",3,blue-dream,0.2728055555555556,0.6187611111111111,True,False,False,0.2862514847268811,0.0032218850323931887,0.8332623357243888,0.1861067113060404,0.9801197103806666,158,False,0.7202396771219489,0.08951574137025314,False,True,inflamation_insomnia,True

I could walk, think, and talk straight but it did have a light relaxing and calming effect that helped to reduce pain. I can compare it to a mild caffeine buzz.   my second experience with cannabis was Blue Dream. I vaped it and let me tell you what. within two minutes my body felt heavy (almost paralyzed), eyes droopy, I couldn't keep one coherent thought in my head for more than 30 seconds. I could hear my own heart beating loudly. It was intense and I definitely could not function so I went to bed. It was an unexpected trip. my first 3 or 4 draws on my vape I thought nothing was happening.  Then out of nowhere, I felt like gravity turned up and I was heavier. I wanted to take another draw but my hand felt like it was too heavy to move. The experience was definitely different from a CBD heavy THC light strain. I'm a lightweight when it comes to alcohol and I'm definitely a lightweight when it comes to this strain. my first experience was fun but terrifying.

432,SpanishGuitarist,"I relate to this strain as a medical strain that uplifts facing woes in life, relaxes muscles, and is a strain that does not alter normal interaction with the outside world. I tried it several times for allergies and related headaches, and it is a miracle for that.  Blueberry/Haze Genetics:  The Blueberry/Haze mix sounds like a mix of polar opposites. The Blueberry is from  DJ Short,  bread exotic strains that integrated Indica varieties with the international set of Sativa strains that were intense.   Haze can make some feel racy, unfocused and anxious. Or for some, an out-of-body experience.   With Blue Dream the unwanted side effects of either strain disappear and create a kind and gentle strain that I feel is more for medical purposes than recreational. It is not the most exciting strain.  Yet popular demand proves me wrong. In California Blue Dream disappears of the shelf, and is preferred by many for social settings. I put Blue Dream in a unique category as Blueberry Muffin, also from the same Indica roots, as sophisticated cannabis that is healing without being too &quot;Stoney&quot; too function as a normal human being.",4,blue-dream,0.1346774193548387,0.4674731182795699,True,False,False,0.2862514847268811,0.0032218850323931887,0.8332623357243888,0.1861067113060404,0.9801197103806666,184,True,0.866731600325444,0.015465895450864565,True,False,seizures,True

Quality is always guaranteed. Color and scent of blueberry is almost always apparent (the indica leaning BD tends to smell more like diesel in my experience).   If you want value for your buck, this strain is great! Many a time have I gotten discounts on ounces of blue dream.

665,Pete11385,"Blue Dream is nice when you want that combination of Relaxation and Euphoria leaning more to the Sativa side. Great after work smoke when you come home, put on a pot of tea and stoke the cat.  Makes you want to listen to music, read and watch tv and all the same time. Great strain for multitasking.  Does not make you want to go out however and do stuff like the pure Sativas do but rather makes you want to do things indoors, anything from cleaning the kitchen to watching and movie. Gives you the munchies to boot.  Has a slight sexual stimulation about it and puts you somewhat in the mood.  Makes you more jovial and able to I socialize if you do decide to break out of the house.  Finally, when itâ€™s all done and it lasts a good while it eases you gently off to sleep like a fluttering cascade of Midsummer Nights Dream Shakespearean Fairies where you dream of Middle Earth and having tea with Bilbo.

668,wh67,"After researching and reading reviews, me and my girlfriend were very excited to experience Blue Dream's creative properties and get high as hell. It did not disappoint.  The buds were moist, covered in crystals, and smelt absolutely stunning. We decided to roll &quot;too much&quot; in our scooby doob in order to get a full feel of the strain.  We're not claiming to be marijuana connoisseurs but it definitely left us with a sweet taste in our soon to be dry mouths.  I personally get a tight feeling in my chest when I smoke, and it would be fair to say that the Blue Dream definitely exacerbated it. My girlfriend also mentioned her heart racing and feeling a bit paranoid, but DO NOT let this put you off.  Five minutes after finishing the zoot, its effects began to wash over us rather like a rising tide. Our legs tingled and I felt like my brain was getting a massage. We were compelled to do something, anything, productive. We cleaned, we tidied, we baked and it felt like we were just getting started. We sat in front of the television, and this is where our journey began.  The soothing voice of David Attenborough ushered us into Madagascar. We were instantly captivated, transported from a small bedroom in the North to a jungle off the east coast of Africa in a matter of seconds. HS2 can suck it. My jaw literally dropped at the sight of minute lizards, baby monkeys and lemurs. We thought of nature in a completely different way.  The 'come-down' was soft and we chatted for the rest of the evening. We were high for over three hours and didn't feel sober by bed-time about six hours after sparking the Jumbo Dumbo.

683,infinitefire,"A glass of red wine at the end of the day is just not gonna cut it anymore. Only Blue Dream can truly tale the edge off. Finally,â€™a strain I genuinely feel better with! I have MS, so I suffer from Chronic Fatigue, cognition and visual impairment, anxiety and depression, so I hate strains that make me feel glued to the couch, anxious, paranoid, or dumb so Blue Dream is the strain for me. I do not get the munchies which is good. It also is very smooth and delicious so it doesnt exacerbate my asthma unlike some other atrains like AK-47 and Mauie Wowie. It doesnt give me bounds of energy, but it keeps me awake enough to enjoy wjatever Im doing, and supports me from falling into the black abyss of fatigue attack. A gentle euphoria but I still have all my wits about me. Whatever Im doing, Im still in complete control, without the worrying. This is like a massage for my soul. It smoothes out the kinks in my psyche and melts away the stress. Also, this strain seems to have long-term benefits. Ever since Ive been smoking this more frequently, my creativity has been amplified, even on days I havent smoked, which is wonderful.

Staid almost (like anything cannabis can be 'staid').  It definitely isn't sexy.  If we were comparing it to red wine, we'd call it a 'quaffing wine'.  Great for a party, maybe not the top choice for a gourmet dinner.  But if you're having a burger instead of filet mignon?  Blue Dream is perfect. The euphoria comes on quickly.

718,FutchAndCalli,"Blue Dream is a decent strain to be sure. But itâ€™s only a solid B as a weed for sex. Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s strong ratings come from it being everywhere and the first quality strain many new users encounter. However, it suffers from the problem I find with many hybrids: they are good at everything, but great at nothing (other than being good). We generally shy away from hybrids like this, where people describe a range of experiences and a â€œchoose your own adventureâ€ù ability to steer it in a sativa or indica direction.  We much prefer strains with more distinct characteristics so we know what weâ€™re getting. That way we can choose a strain that fits the mood and time of day rather than trying to steer through the high and hoping it works out. However, if youâ€™re new to this and want a â€œjack of all tradesâ€ù strain, you can do a lot worse than Blue Dream. Itâ€™s just not for us unless the choices are seriously limited.   We are 50-somethings who vape and have sex pretty much daily. All our reviews focus on our experiences mixing cannabis and sex. We only rate after using an oz so the reviews give a well-rounded impression that captures a strainâ€™s potential, downsides, and typical effects.

720,kimdavis3,"This is one of my favorite strains!!!  I am a daily user and the effects for me are very strong and intense and, very enjoyable.  For me, mostly a head high.  It makes me talkative, happy, goofy and generally in good spirits.  I could still focus on tasks, as long as they weren't too complicated.  For me this is definitely a strain where you want to be in an unstructured or party environment.  I would suggest using this strain for pain relief as I think it is distracting and could take your mind off your pain.  I strongly encourage those who can handle the effects to use it for lack of appetite!!  I gain weight when using this strain for any period of a week or more, because I always get the munchies after using it.  Usually it takes two or three sessions, but after the effects are waning I become ravenous - especially for sugar and salt.

I strongly recommend smoking this out of a pipe or chillum. Anything with water in it like a bubbler or a bong just cuts down on its potency. Definitely use a small bowl pipe, you don't need alot of it if you're smoking by yourself.  It seems like it's similar to White Widow's effects, just more sharper and focused, and hits faster. You'll find yourself completely lost in your thoughts and still have enough functionality to get around in the house to do whatever you need to do before finally chilling and riding out the rest of the high. Like White Widow, its a great meditative strain, super-functional on the mental scale. It's like the strain has a very helpful mind of its own, guiding you closer to solutions of your own issues, kind of like what a Boy Scout or a Girl Scout would do with other people, always lending a helping hand. Learned a great deal as this somehow switched my mind around to the point it's like an ongoing Jeopardy! thing going on.  All in all, GREAT time with this strain!

746,MZ_PHD_in_420,"I have 40+ years experience growing and using cannabis, a masters degree in agri/horticulture from MSU. This review is more of a warning and a review than most of my other reviews. The review is of the actual flower which I have never produced myself but am pretty sure I have sampled the real deal. I agree with every positive review, if you indeed get the real deal but my warning is that with the exception of the flower itself and obtaining it from a reliable source, any clones or seeds that are said to be GSC are highly unlikely to be. I have seen and know of many people that paid for supposed GSC clones and seeds and none of them were GSC and actually none of them were of any quality at all, so there are a lot of people selling items claiming to be GSC when they are actually total junk. Unlike other people trying to copy the strain and producing a great strain that may not be the same but good in its own right, it seems most of the people claiming to have this strain are completely lying and selling complete junk. Now obviously this isn't the case all the time, but from what I have seen, it is the most counterfeited strain I have witnessed, so please be aware of this if you are trying to obtain clones or seeds. I would only get them from a place that has both a sample of the flower AND whatever else they are offering so you can at least see what you should expect. This is the reason I would love to have but have no experience growing, because even though I have a lot of reliable connections for many strains, this is one I have not been able to trust the source enough to commit to growing it.

773,215CutReviews629,"  In the mid-16th century, when the tulip was first introduced there, Western Europe fell in love with the new flower.  The Dutch simply couldnâ€™t get enough of the late blooming Tulip, contract prices on bulbs soared to ten times the average annual income of a skilled craftsman - for a single bulb!  What goes up, must come down, and prices quickly collapsed, resulting in what many economists say is the first economic bubble.         Girl Scout Cookies, allegedly a three-way cross of OG Kush, Durban Poison, and Cherry Kush (one stage of the cross being an accidental pollination from a hermaphroditic flower), was available to a few limited people who knew somebody in the Bay Area.  When it first found its way to the Harborside clone counter, it was available for $50, or some such nonsense.  It could be had a few weeks earlier on Craigslist for $500.  Of course, counterfeits abounded, both at Harborside, and on Craigslist.  Iâ€™m sure many unfortunate investors watched as their $500 cuts grew slowly (and it is a slow-growing cut) toward motherhood as prices tumbled, or cloned out their exclusive cookie cut just in time to find out it was actually sour diesel.        I got mine when Dark Heart's cuts of it fell to under $20. That was a little over a year ago.  Now, cookie cuts seem to cost the same as everything else does.       This is an indeterminate cut, that starts a little slow, but stretches late into flower, forming solid branches, studded at intervals with dense, trichome covered buds.  The leaves accumulate chlorophyll, growing deep green in the late weeks of flower, breaking to a rich purple with cooler conditions and a proper flush.        Although the buds are dense, and of an easy and uniform quality, the yield is lower, due to greater spacing of individual internodes, and a lesser tendency to grow out its secondary branches.  It does train well, but because of late stretch, will often grow in a taller, sparse patch, when compared to most other strains.  This plant burns relatively easily, as it tends to concentrate nutrients in its fan leaves.  This means that it requires both a longer flush, and a gentle hand with the bloom fertilizers.        This plant, true to its origins, has shown a tendency to create the occasional staminate (male) flower, without much rhyme or reason as to its cause.  These tend to form lower on the plant, in the first few weeks of flower, directly next to the stamen at the base of an internode on a main stem.  They are not a cause for alarm, and will rarely pollinate neighboring plants, but they do occasionally pollinate the stamen theyâ€™re attached to.  In this case, the stamen attached to the stem will begin to swell.  The seeds formed will be a feminized self copy of the original plant, no more or less likely to hermie than its mother. My current cutting of cookies is actually a grown out seed from a flowered plant.  I have found these seeds a few times.       This plant produces almost completely dense buds when grown with a reasonable canopy depth.  Waiting until the second or third week of flower to trim undergrowth will help somewhat with density, while avoiding stretch. I find that this cut takes 9-10 weeks to finish.      The cured buds have aromas of menthol, lemon grass, dankness, and a hint of curacao.  Early in the cure, menthol predominates, fading while the dankness increases as the cure progresses.  The final effect after a few months is a minty sour diesel with extra dankness.  The overall intensity of this cut is impressive, in terms of aroma, density, and potency.      Any cut with such intense popularity will attract its detractors, and Cookies is no exception.  This cut has several downsides: low yield, difficult stretch, a tendency to burn and a long flush time.  The first batch of Cookies crosses and variants (Iâ€™ve even got a Blue Cheese x Cookies cut I worked up that shows promise) are just starting to arrive at the clone counters, and eventually weâ€™re likely to see a cross that retains the good while losing all the bad.  But for now, if you want a jar full of Cookies, youâ€™ll have to make do.

Sometimes, this strain can be a bit too psychoactive for me, given the strength of its Durban Poison parent. Unless you purchase a sun-grown variety, GSC strains can be generally high on the THC potency scale. So yes, for more controlled hydroponic variants, a little goes a long way. Baking, however, is the best use of this strain - by far! They don't call it &quot;Girl Scout Cookies&quot; for nothing; grind it, weigh it, and mix it into your brownie mix or cookie dough batter. The flavor blends particularly well with rich, dense baked goods, lending them a very mild and unassuming hint of cannabis without overpowering the edible's natural flavor.

847,PineappleScott,"GSC ... ( the artist formerly known as girl scout cookie )   I have been waiting a looooong time to try this one. Tonight was the night.   This strain's reputation speaks for itself. You've heard of it. Who hasn't ? It's one of today's most iconic strains. It seems like everything has some sort of &quot;cookies&quot; in it ? If they mix it in with that many strains it must be awesome right ?!   Well sort of ....   This pot smelled like pot. With a name like &quot;cookies&quot; I expected something a little more subtle.  I thought &quot; ok ... yup , that's pot &quot; . Lets move along.   I loaded up a bowl of the greenish purple ( almost black ) flower and lit up. The cannabis burned rather quickly and hot. The throat hit took a second and burned pretty bad. It was one of the more harsh smokes i've had in awhile.   The flavor was not sweet at all ... it was very &quot;chemically&quot; almost like you were smoking pine sol. &quot;Candyland&quot; tasted alot similar if you're familiar with that. &quot; It must be some irony here &quot; I thought to myself as I pondered on the weeds namesake. There is nothing sweet or &quot;Cookie-ie&quot; about this stuff. It smells and tastes like shit as well as hitting your throat like an afterburner to a SR-71 blackbird! Not what I was expecting at all.   Then the ol GSC kicked in ... It came rather quickly and hit hard. Like a freight train actually and I had a really hard time remembering things. Everything had a green color sort of kaleidoscope thing going on. Very Very psychedelic. When you look at a tye dye shirt ? That is how you are going to feel. All over the place in an abyss of color. Stunning visual effects. This stuff kicked my ass. Very Very Strong. Do not take around kids or in a situation where you might be needed to drive or anything. You wouldnt (should'nt).   My mind felt very quiet. Alot of pot makes me feel like i'm in this wind tunnel. GSC made me feel like I was the only human in space , and everything was quiet. Dead quiet.   For someone with a really deep depression or in need of a wild pain relief or anxiety bomb. This would probably do something for you. I know we've all had those times where we just want to hit the ejection button. This will hit that button for you. You will eject into the vastness and silence of space. And for better or for worse you'll have whatever thoughts you take in there with you, and nothing else.   This is really going to smack the hell out of you psychologically.    So I would say this is more of a &quot;hail mary&quot; medicinally ... You need to score a touch down mentally and you only have 7 seconds with no timeouts with 76 yards to go downfield. You need to get some sort of relief quick and you're willing to take a big risk to get it at this point. That is also GSC.   If you dont mind a chemically stinky harsh NUCLEAR MIND BOMB then GSC is definitely up your alley.   Not for the feint of heart. No it does not taste nor smell nor in any minuscule way resemble cookies.

The version I had left me really tired on the come down with a slight headache.  The high can be pretty strong if you take too many pulls. I was trying to adjust the temp on my battery and wound up taking about 5 pulls. That was too much for me and sunk me into my couch with side A of Led Zeppelin II on the turntable. Even though the pressing is pretty crappy I felt like I was right there in the audience.  After the side ended I got up to change the side and got very light headed and uneasy on my feet.

1079,420IndigoChild,"For me and my girlfriend, smoking is a bonding experience. After each hit, I love talking with her, Whether it be about our day, us and our future, or life experiences or little things. This weed is GREAT for that, take your time with it, take a hit from the bong and let it take its course and fully hit you before taking another. Experience each kind of high.

1081,petethekoala,"This review is an update of a previous review I made a few months ago about our famous OG Kush that many consider as the god of cannabis, especially here on the West Coast. I first rated this strain as a 4 because the reality is, because of it's fame, a lot of growers planted this seed but after that only cared about money and the name so they ended up on the shelves with a somewhat average to no good product. Since then I tried a lot of good quality products in this range of strains so I have to give it back it's 5 (4,8 to be exact). This is a great herb that gives you both a powerful body and head buzz. Had a very fun and creative trip most of the times I was on this one. In term of taste it's a kush taste so Earth, Sweet, Pine,  Wood blended so it' become a Hashish mashup with citrus and herbal notes. It's great for party, socials, artistic creativity and hiking. Kills pain instantly. It can go either for anxiety (get rid of social anxiety in my case). Just be cautious if you're a new cannabis user because too much can make you really anxious and paranoid (happened to a friend and myself I was a little anxious on this one once). Just control yourself and the flaws I mentioned won't happen or will be easy to control. Not for beginners.

1109,tripdog,"I am reviewing the outdoor version of this flower, obtained from 61eleven dispensary, the drive-thru collective in San Diego.    The appearance is a medium green with few visible brown/tan pistils. Trichome coverage to the naked eye is very light, but under a loupe they are more apparent. The smell is a prototypical earthy, spiced, kush-type smell. Smell-wise it is nowhere near as pungent as some of the indoor OG Kush I've had.    If I'm honest it doesn't have much &quot;bag appeal&quot; at all, but the &quot;taste&quot; and &quot;effects&quot; departments are where this bud REALLY shines.     This specimen when smoked, has a robust, flavorful and smooth smoke. It finishes very clean with almost no aftertaste. It's quite honestly one of the best tasting Kush's I've sampled to date.    What this particular OG Kush lacks in &quot;bag appeal&quot; it makes up for big time in the effects department. First, it is an extremely uplifting high that could be compared to that of a Sativa, but without any paranoia or racing thoughts. The effects are always predictable, a happy enjoyable high that is long lasting without being too &quot;couchy&quot; or demotivating. It does finish with a pretty heavy burn out so I can't fully recommend it for a daytime smoke.

1132,Anonymous,"     Extremely good strain! A definite reason for the rage. The high is something different, an &quot;awake&quot; type indica (it is mainly sativa with indica in its heritage) that has the ability to both lift mood, moderately stimulate, awaken, but also give an amazingly euphoric body high, especially at higher doses. Puts me in just a happy, comfortable (both mentally and physically), content and interested state. Might I add, this strain is great with music. Music sounds especially fantastic and the creative jive of this bud come through during that activity, at least for me.         To add, it is long lasting without much comedown.          I did get a tiny bit of anxiety, though it was mild and extremely quick moving, more my own doing than the buds. Very mild, hard to truly feel a sense of anxiety with this bud, and you are put in a mindset to let it pass, not dread it.

Whether its tahoe, ghost, sfv, hells angels, s.a.c , diablo, fire, legend, true, platinum etc. they are all some amazing genetics. Deep funky flavors of fuel, pine, redwoods, citrus, fresh tennis balls, wet dog, burnt popcorn, new rubber bands, and other weird thiols and terpene profiles are found here in great nuance.

Please ppl keep in mind that this strain originated here in the 90's and it started out as a very simple cross; (Lemon skunk x Hindu kush).

By adding Chemdawg and changing the original lemon SKUNK to lemon THAI added a much higher sativa effect as Thai is a pure sativa and skunk is a hybrid which added a more powerful sativa effect along with adding Chemdawg to the mix made this a whole new OG kush pheno and so on and so forth.

1150,EcoBGreen,"OG Kush is one of the consistently - noticeably stronger highs on the market.  It is so good many rappers in the Atlanta area - go out of their way for anything with OG in the title - because they get blown away by the strength of different blends. And it is hard to beat the Oregon/Original Ghost Kush - OG Kush - stinky, funky, even a fruity/cheesy taste and room filling smell.  It is easy to get so high you temporarily get stuck in your head.  Snoop Dogg &amp; Friends in LA are outspoken about the OG Kush hardcore party weed vibe. Red Dragon, however, is moving toward becoming the &quot;it&quot; weed, now.  While OG Kush gives you a powerful stoners rush - Red Dragon gives a super long THC mind altering experience that would be good for both creative artists or partiers going to a music concert.  It alleviates anxiety, allows for focus, so you can enjoy whatever you are doing while on it.  Aphrodisiac quality - a super sexy high - with an exotic guava fruit taste and smell. If you want to test yourself on being able to handle your weed - the only thing currently that takes it to the next level has OG Kush as a grandchild of a cannabis strain development effort -called Elektraslide.  When it comes to pushing cannibinoid levels Elektraslide is a freak offspring plant from Holy Grail Kush and SAGE - both in the top 5 strongest weeds tested potency in the world.  Lemon, chalky, alien haze goes down smooth, but expands in the lungs quickly.  It takes down even the most advanced or experienced smoker.  The THC is stratospheric, but so is the CBD, and CBN numbers.  The Holy Grail Kush had two of the highest cannabinoid levels in being Kosher Kush x OG Kush.  The incredibly high THCa content comes from SAGE pushes the complimentary THC genetics even higher than previously thought possible.  Gives a highly tingly body rush with electric currents racing over the skin, if over half a pin joint is smoked.  It also tends to lock a person down, while doing the above.  Elektraslide is still not in the commercial market.  Got a taste from an underground Atlanta connection.  Most memorable smoke in the last 30 years.

1193,kastour,"I picked up some OG Kush the other day and decided to try it out tonight. Being a lightweight and this being a new strain to me, I smoked a very small joint (.1g) to myself after a walk to a nearby convenience store (1-2 minutes from home) and then went home. I felt the effects almost immediately - after a minute or so of walking I felt what some may describe as a body buzz (I'm not super experienced so I'm not sure if that's what this was) I felt very light, as if I was walking on a cloud or just floating. It didn't cause me to stumble or anything, and I made it home fine.  I walked in about 5 minutes after finishing my pinner, fiending for the pomegranate that I had prepared before leaving in anticipation of getting the munchies. Unfortunately, my mom asked me to help her with the laundry unexpectedly, so I went straight to the basement and started sorting hangers and folding hot towels from the dryer. Among the metal wire hangers and couple wooden ones was this weird matte-plastic hanger that really tripped me out when I touched it. The feeling of it seemed so unnatural to me that I actually stopped and asked my mom to feel it and tell me if it felt weird (she said it didn't). The towels were fresh from the dryer, so they were pretty hot, and they made my hands/fingers tingle as I was folding them. By the time I'd finished the laundry, it'd been about 20 minutes since I finished smoking. Just as I finished, the thought of a cucumber popped into my head for no reason, and the taste filled my mouth. I could imagine it so vividly that on my way up to my room I grabbed an entire cucumber and brought it upstairs to eat with my pomegranate. I devoured the cucumber, ate the entire bowl of pomegranate, then ate the half bag of chips that was sitting on my computer desk, along with a litre of Pepsi. I then frantically ran around my house desperately looking for more food. It's about time to go grocery shopping, so the house is pretty much dry. I found a stray package of cookies with 5-10 left, killed those, and then gave up on my search.  I spent the rest of my night playing video games (League of Legends), telling a close friend of mine how important she was to me and that she was gorgeous after she asked me how I thought of her looks when I mentioned that another friend told me to try and date her after seeing some of her pictures. I was really affectionate and at the same time really enjoying my League matches, playing with her and a few other friends. That consisted of the next few hours of my night, and I'm here about 5 hours after that joint very satisfied with my high.  I had a short spurt of anxiety (I'm diagnosed with panic disorder, so finding good strains of weed is tricky) but it went away quickly. Other than that, I have no complaints. I recommend this strain, if and only if you have sufficient food because the munchies I got from this weed was ridiculous.",3,og-kush,0.07091218305504018,0.5652401566687282,True,False,False,0.27953815309771285,0.003223498516978507,0.8690755045671138,0.29036993455784654,0.9533290088242568,181,True,0.9784196232694262,0.1493315443898961,True,False,nausea,True

1235,SpanishGuitarist,"The term OG is nebulas at best. The roots of hybrids from the past 30 years are amalgamated into &quot;OG&quot;. But that is where it all begins. Having Thai, Columbian, Mexican and Afghani roots is a mix of phenomes, terpenes, and especially effects that can dominate the Indica spectrum with Sativa highlights. But depending on the cultivar, it can be the perfect mix.  Recently in NorCal we have seen &quot;Pure Kush&quot;, and &quot;OG&quot; become perennials. The Chemdawg roots from Landrace Varieties permeates the lineage, but the cultivar can use this a their palette to accomplish new levels of Cannabis.    Because of the years of breeding for stability, these days cloning OG to any strain produces a great result. And why not... The early Sativas were flowereing too long for non-tropic environments, and OG is the magical generic root for a great prodect; it does not need a long flowering time where results are possibly limited.  But the Sativa/Indica ratio can be altered easily. So now what about OG?   In NorCal, it is a cult favorite in its purist form.

I actually took 3 puffs when I should of had 2 because I'm writing this the next day. ;) So yes it knocked me out but what was so good is I finally slept through the night. I always wake up from the pain. For me I'll be taking 2 puffs from my pen and my pain in my joints is amazingly controlled. So I'll start doing this every 4-6 hours.

1254,Rhanex,"OG Kush is one of the most well-known and popular (highly potent) hybrid strains on the market. But, surprisingly, its lineage has been a closely guarded secret (or, rather, given its origins, no one can say conclusively). Nonetheless, many people (â€œin the knowâ€ù) believe OG Kush is a cross between the hybrid Chemdawg and legendary pure-Indica landrace strain, Hindu Kush. Because â€œallegedlyâ€ù (it could be stoner legend), OG Kush originally came from bag seed at a Grateful Dead show (back in the early 1990s), its lineage remains unconfirmed.  OG Kush produces consistent effects: a well-balanced head and body high, complemented by with intense euphoria and cerebral sensations.

As the day went on the amazing feeling from this OG kush stayed with me for surprisingly a significant amount longer than any other weed Iâ€™ve had, and even after it did wear off my legs felt extremely light for hours after.

1270,ChillWizard,"One of my deserted island strains for sure. It hits me pretty strong and fast without any wondering if I need another hit or not. Relaxing and uplifting with a generally hypnotic stone in both my mind and body. Buried alive. I have some difficulty talking which is good because I talk too much anyway. I'd rather stagger into the silent stone zone anyway, but you can still navigate life if you need to, but it tends to shorten my social interaction if talking to regular people who aren't high, because I am still aware of how freakin' baked I must appear. This is a good thing for me.  Also, after smoking this for a few weeks straight I never built up any tolerance to it, so the same amount got me just as high, time after time, day after day.

1271,ActualFactual,"In distillate form; was recommended for night-time use and pre-sleep medication to aid with insomnia, restless leg syndrome, restlessness, etc.  The cartridge I have specifically states &quot;Indica&quot; and I do believe there are 2 OG Kush varietals (at least!!) out there - one a hybrid, the other a dominant Indica.  Regardless, interesting medicine.  With the distillate, one long haul is usually measure enough to ascertain potency and effect.  In the case of this strain, it felt very familiar at the onset - definitely not as relaxing and numbing as a strong Indica - but it was relaxing and calmed my body down nonetheless.  However, I did lay in bed for a good hour enjoying the head-trip, then slowly started to enter a sleep-state, then, as though someone suddenly stopped the movie reel; it was LIGHTS ON and I was up!!  Seems as though when this stuff wears off, it perks you up.  Least it did last night, we'll try again tonight.  Anyway - after a weird moment I took another small hit off the cartridge and made my way back to bed where I did awake this morning, not as well rested as I'd hoped for, but I'm off to bed again now.  As for the product - chemmy aftertaste but that's typical with distillates in my vaping experience.  It's a solid narcotic feeling strain, I can see it worked well in calming my body, my mind not so much.  Let's see what tonight's experiments hold!!  Decent.  Strong, good on the body, introspective, efficient and potent, relaxes the muscles for sure, dry mouth which dissipates after about an hour.  ***UPDATE:  Tried again for night time use; seems this strain - while narcotic in its feel and effect, isn't the best night time sleep aid as, say, GDP or Blue God are.  Still decent enough for a calming body effect, but not so much to be lights out material.  Enjoyable nonetheless, just not knock-out material for sleep.  Will be trying G13 and a couple other Indica dominant distillates for sleep and will report back my findings***",4,og-kush,0.12218364197530862,0.4470679012345678,True,False,False,0.27953815309771285,0.003223498516978507,0.8690755045671138,0.29036993455784654,0.9533290088242568,174,False,0.7884248316519273,0.021346845957953844,False,True,fatigue_headaches,False

However, I have never had such a bad experience with weed in my life as I have with OG Kush. I was extremely paranoid that the police were outside my house based on absolutely no evidence (underage at the time) and the weed was so dank and so foul-smelling my roommates were pissed for bringing it into the house. Straight up skunky. I became extremely anxious and stayed under my covers too stoned to move for the entire high. I even had some auditory hallucinations, which I still to this day have never experienced with other strains. I heard voices, water running and crickets - none of which were actually there.

I would apologize for that. In the meantime, while all of this started in what 2010, then a couple of years back for Arizona.

1399,chronicallymedicated,"Initial impression: My bud-tender said in the usual tone &quot;what'll it be?&quot; I chirped back, &quot;surprise me, something new from the cannaseur shelf' please&quot;. So I was handed a newer strain aptly named &quot;Mother's Milk. The other one was Gorilla Glue #4 (GG)&quot; (reviewed in this post). Needless to say, I was pretty excited about both of these. I sampled this one in a pre-rolled cone form, also rolled with &quot;Raw Cones&quot; thanks to the talented hands of Jazzy J at Medicine Man's Medical Market, located in Glendale, CO.  I use a scale of 10 points, 10 being the highest possible score in any category, with 3 total categories, Taste / Aroma / Potency.  Aroma: 10.0 (+1.) bonus. This is the highest number of points I have ever awarded any strain for its aroma. The smell from this strain is so unique, I have never smelled anything like it ever. It had an incredibly strong pungent earthy aroma, with overtones of powerful industrial ammonia. Damn, is all I can really say about this strain. Kudos to the growers for this strain, really, it is something special. I would not want to grow a bunch of this indoors, you would need some serious filters, it would smell like a huge uncleaned litter box, in terms of a real strong odor of cat piss.  Taste: 9.5 The taste of this bud was something quite different than its scent. Like the aroma, the taste was also heavy. I was glad that the taste of this did not overwhelm me like its aroma. The initial taste of this is more earthy and piney than its smell leads you to believe. Regardless, this is by far the tastiest strain I have had aside from Jenny Kush in quite a while. It was intense, and mellow at the same time. Really a wonderful strain, with lots to offer.  Potency: 9.0 The strength of this euphoria was intense. This strain has provided me with one of the more intense body and head highs of any strain that I have reviewed to date. The high came on almost immediately, and was pretty intense in terms of its psychedelic intensity, the body high was great also, I felt lethargically focused, if that makes any sense. I was in full effect of the indica part also, and here is what I mean. I needed a seat belt for reality, but I was intensely focused on the movie I had on, &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;.  Final opinion: I thought this strain was really really great! The potency was strong, the aroma was powerful and the taste was exceptional, this is a textbook example of perfection. Great job to all of those involved in the production and distribution of this awesome strain. This strain when they have more will be in my private stash for the really long snow days we get in Denver. I would implore you (the reader) try this strain if you have the means to, it is absolutely worth it.  Total points awarded: 29.5 out of 30 (plus 1 bonus point in the aroma category). I would rate this strain 5.0 stars, I feel that this strain deserves every point it earned! This is not a strain for novices.

1400,MZ_PHD_in_420,"SOON TO BE TOP !0 STRAIN OF ALL TIME!!!I have 40+ years experience growing and using cannabis, a masters degree in agri/horticulture from MSU and will break each review down as follows from my own personal experience with seeds or clones obtained directly from the original breeders. I received my clone directly from the person that entered it in the 2014 Michigan High Times Cannabis Cup, where it won for the second time taking 1st place.  -USE: Hands down one of the best strains around and will soon be on the lists of the best strains of all time. One of the reasons it is so good is because it is the perfect combination of everything, Indica, Sativa, THC content, taste, smell, it's the perfect strain. It's really good for everything and can really be used all day long. I'm not even going to describe anything like effect, what it's good for, taste or potency because you can just fill them all in. The taste is amazing and like everything else, hard to describe because it like walking in a flower shop and asking what flowers you smell. All of them!!LOL    -GROW: If you can get you hands on an actual cut, than there is nothing better both indoors and out. Easy to grow, great yield, mold resistance and not to long of a lowering time. Keep in mind that this strain was created by self pollination so you can expect to find hermies and seeds but they are few and far between and shouldn't bother anyone because the end product is so good. Indoors the average finish time is 9-10 depending on the amount of light used. Outdoor: at 42*N latitude it could be picked on Oct. 1st but optimum time is Oct. 10-14th.  NOTE: GG4 is pretty easy to spot if you have an actual cut because it's final appearance is pretty unique. Both before picking and after drying the flowers have very few noticeable pistols/red hairs.

1402,purpleurklealienchempantsdogkush,"Bee's Knees? Cat's Pajamas? Although these are incredibly accurate, they do not come close to encompassing my view on Gorilla Glue.  When sir Smokes-a-lot gets a pound of Mr. Nice Guy's sweetest cheeba, he immediately notes how he can &quot;smell it through the bag, baby&quot;.  Well, if you're within 10 yards of this flower, your sense of smell will be climaxing from the sweet piny spice of those little green buds that you just wanna shove them in your mouth and eat them so much, awwwww CRAP........I just licked my computer screen......The effects are unreal chill, and take away my chronic back pain.  In fact, sometimes I feel like it takes my back away completely.  The sativa effect is most noted in my experience starting out pretty heavy.  I noticed this when I was in the bathroom upstairs in my office, of which my wife has been trying to get me to keep the door shut (even when no one is in there).  Her solution to get me to remember?  To booby trap me with a computer keyboard outside the door, so I would trip and remember to close the door.  Not the coolest thing she's ever done, but very effective.  I got to thinking, I'm 35 and I remember getting in trouble for messing with the family Apple IIe without permission because my parents thought I would break it somehow.  And those things were indestructible, I mean I'm pretty sure I remember having an entire dinner plate firmly inserted into the floppy drive at one point, and that didn't even void the warranty.  Nowadays, technology has apparently become so advanced, and electronics have become so common that we are willing to use their components as booby traps to teach our spouses lessons, so we can hopefully save a few cents a month on our electric bill.   As I sat there pondering this after inhaling the beautiful pharmaceutical knows as &quot;Gorilla Glue&quot;, it occurred to me - This stuff was 100% legit.  Not the inconsiderate type of weed that we all smoked in high school because it was the best stuff around at the time.  You know, the kind where you're headed out with friends so you pack a bowl at your buddy's parents' house who were out of town before you go out for the night.  Then once you're stoned and ready to leave, you gotta wait on your buddy to finish his turkey sandwich, then you start to  wish you had snuck another hit or two in the rotation because you're already starting to come down and get the yawns.  NO, GG#4 is the kind of considerate weed that holds the door for your mom, texts you on your birthday, and if you spend the night and fall asleep on the couch early - covers you up with a blanket so you don't wake cold.  GG hangs with you for the perfect amount of time - doesn't cut out early like your buddies after you have a party at your place who conveniently have to leave right before clean up time.  No, GG is there for you.  Making sure you are taken care of.  Until it lets me down, it's my go to strain.   Taste - UNREAL Smell - OFF THE CHARTS Effects - TOTALLY KILLER What more are you really looking for?  If you want something that will put you to sleep, this isn't it.  If you want something that will give you a full body buzz and no cerebral euphoria, try knocking on some Indica's door, because this gift from God will take you to some untouched realms of your internal psyche and you'll be better for it.

I'm a 35 y/o male, mainly portuguese descent with some American Indian (Native American), and a small mix of others. Type O- blood. I was in a fasted state for 16 hours (Intermittent fasting 8/16) when I smoked some. I started cooking breakfast about ten minutes later, I was slightly agitated prior to smoking and now feel calm, but not out of it. As I was making breakfast I started to cook more, and more. I ate two eggs, french toast, andouille sausage link, 1 cup of blueberries, and was able to finish the entire meal due to the great munchies effect. I feel good, not too up, or too down, but I do feel like relaxing. I'm going to try smoking an equal amount and finish this after about 10 mins or so.   I'm back, I took a little more than the first, which I took about two inhales compared to one inhale off a quarter of an average bowl. If you read my other reviews you can compare my moods and see that this one makes me feel more uplifted, but not so much euphoric. I definitely feel the right side of my brain being activated more now that I'm about 15-20 mins out. The second high kicked in - heavy eyes, relaxed muscles, slight chair lock, brain function has declined now, lol, I feel like I'm forcing my brain to concentrate. No negative side effects so far. You can clearly see the difference between dosing a slight amount, and dosing a heavy amount, whereas my larger, second amount is more of what most people describe as the effects of gorilla glue.

1412,ChronicComic,"Quick review: (NOTE: all my reviews are done with a onie and one bowl only taking 4 hits) Great strain,perfect for sleep, attacks the head and eyes. Indica strong. Still has a nice body tingle which would help you relax if you are like me and have restless leg syndrome that prevents you from relaxing long enough to slip to sleep.   Detailed review Smell: I'd say this smells very chemically with a sweet flowery smell like you would find with 'green crack'   Look: Very light dense buds with short orange/red hairs occasionally popping up. Coated incredibly nice with trichromes, it could only be described as looking really kiefy.   Taste: Like the smell, it has an initial chemical taste with an earthy wood after taste.   Feeling: It was a slow start that crept up on my eyes. It hit me in the forehead first and moved around to my entire head in probably a span of 5 minutes. Next your extremities start to tingle, like that feeling after you just shocked yourself. It has a slight energy to it that could make it useful if you were to be doing something (like writing an interview as I am now) but i would definitely use this to go to sleep. I would NOT use as a &quot;wake and bake&quot; or afternoon smoke, I would say this is the &quot;wait till after work and you just had a crappy day and need to relax on the couch and put on your favorite episode of Firefly&quot; kinda strain that really helps you relax when your on edge. Good strain for ADHD, Insomnia, muscle pain and anxiety. Probably not a good strain for depression, exercising or operating any kind of machinery that isn't an xbox controller. All in all this is an amazing strain 9/10 that I would want to have around for those crappy days and sleepless nights.  I purchased this strain from High Country Healing off of Academy in Colorado Springs. This strain was recomended to me from the manager who was incredibly helpful and has been time and time again. HCH is my &quot;go to&quot; dispensary  for the best strains I have tried so far. I will keep coming back to try all of their top shelf buds so I can add them to my arsenal of medication.

1448,Fernand,"Nice dark flavorful Gorilla Glue Oil. I'm dabbing some on a sore inside a nostril, so the whole world smells sweet &amp; dank. This is a subtle Gorilla. Maybe it's Gorilla Glue #6 ;-). It's serious medicine, I don't think it's for the get-fucked-up crowd :  because the effect is so specific. I don't really notice the (78%) THC so much. It's rather masked or antagonized by other components. So there's no squirrel cage shutter-flutter, no anxieties, no confusion, and some might say &quot;no high&quot;. For social anxiety, it would be a good choice. It's balanced, more on the Indica side -- that unquestionably comes through with a good body melt, and I can believe the reports of couch lock w/ large amounts. Thing is, I wouldn't dream of wasting it that way.  In small amounts it's a blessing for those living with pain. I know pain, and I know remedies. This is the most atypical cannabis I've ever sampled, because it almost feels like puffs of ope, but with a somehow smarter, more benign analgesia than w/ Rx analgesics. Not a simple thing. But it works calm and measured, positive mood, not fake-euphoric, and with significant pain relief, not limited to the lower spine/legs/back. Pretty long lasting. After a while I notice a subtle secondary boost, sensory, and very mild &quot;psychedelic&quot; effects come in. Not a sleepy effect, yet good to fall asleep on. I haven't fully figured it out; it's intriguing.   On the negatives, well, De Quincy would say who cares, but it's clearly not a party strain. I'd add that it's not as clear-headed as e.g. my favorite Diesels. It lasts, but as it decays I get a smidge fuzzy and sleepy, with a touch of headache, eyes a bit redder than I'd have guessed (so it's relaxing blood vessels).   Focus? With the Gorilla, I can focus on tasks, get a little side-tracked, not feeling lightning bright, but keep going.

Temperature: 188C   Gorilla Glue #4 hit hard as expected with its original flavor and showed potential to be an aesthetically marvelous bud.   The bud is radiant and particularly lively. The leaves appear healthy and voluminous. Scarce orange pistils, consistent trichomes, and overall lighter-green shaded flowers. The sight was a nice impression however the accompanying smell had more to be desired.   Though remarkable in many aspects, I found my tasting of this hybrid strain to fall short in its flavor. The initial draw is dense, leaving way into an overwhelming pine flavor with a chemical-flavored tail-end. The pine creates an imbalance of flavors and masks the other scents present within the flower. To have better flavor, the strain's palette of aromas needs to be able to leave more &quot;breathing&quot; room to mature and tame the flower's broad spectrum of tastes. The chemical flavor needs to have some sort of support or complement flavor as well.   The general flavor mellows out after several draws, leaving behind a subtle sourness in the background. Gorilla Glue's original flavor remains within consumers palette for quite some time.   The genetics of the strain are well balanced, making for a manageable hybrid that has noticeable sativa and indica effects. The high is well and manageable.

The buds are large, dense, chunky, and so trichome covered the buds appear almost white. This stuff has tested over 34% THC.  Although GG#4 is a sativa dominant hybrid, its effects are indica dominant especially in high quantities. The strong, long lasting high is good for this with a high tolerance. The effects are initially very euphoric and uplifting, and later sedative and stoney. The sativa qualities fade after a couple of hours and the couch lock effects become much more strongly pronounced.

GG#4 is a perfect afternoon to bedtime strain due to the high chances of you being blissfully couch locked. Expect an intense case of munchies.

Well if you know me you know there is research behind my EVERY claim! lol READ ON! :)  Leafly is the #1 website for reviews. I started by looking at all strains with over 1,000 reviews... there were 30 or so. Next I completely IGNORED the final review score... wait, what? That number is simply the average of all the star ratings (0-6), I wanted something more useful. PS, You should see me look for an amazon product, it takes me hours before I click the buy button! lol  I was interested in the NEGATIVE numbers, so after gathering all the data for each strain by capturing the HTML source code from each review page (that's called 'scrubbing'), the final number was the percent of reviews with a zero or one.  I want to have the LEAST chance of a bad experience... purrrrfect number!  GG4 was the overwhelming winner, with 1 percent of users rating it 0 or 1. The other 29 or so ranged from 2 to 30!  The top 5 were: GG4 = 1% negative reviews Gelato = 2% Platinum GSC = 4% Death Star = 5% Tahie OG Kush = 5%  So why stop there? &lt;oh nooooo&gt; hehe  I did the same on three other, less popular websites, then averaged the three final scores together with Leafly weighted 50% more than the other two (after throwing out ANY that had a 10% or higher negative score).

I would love to be at the dispensary just smelling away at these.  The smell is so addicting.  Flavor:  Earthy, Pine, small hint of citrus.  I used a PAX3 vape on level 3.  My first initial reaction was this made me feel super heavy in the shoulders.  I was so relaxed that I started to slump off the couch and onto the floor.  I didn't know what to expect, it made me so couch locked, more like floor locked, that I didn't know what to do other than just stay there and keep listening to The Defenders on Netflix.  I had a hard time keeping my eyes open but I was completely awake.  Here's the weird part, there was some taste was linking in my mouth, something sweet, I cant explain what it is, I don't care.  I liked it.  now every time I smoke it, I taste this unexplainable flavor that's stuck in my mouth. Now that I have a little more tolerance, I can do things around the house.  I suffer from chronic joint pain caused by a lot sports injuries, I usually run a CBD based topical on my aching joints with GG4 post training and it helps.

1497,hughlaurie,"This is a really interesting strain: a LOT of classic-stoner effects, but it pushes all the stoner effects too far, too fast, so none of them are really desirable.  Another user called this a sugar rush strain. I 100% agree. It temporarily speeds you up, and then you CRASH into couch-lock. No good. Do you ACTUALLY like sugar-rushes? Me neither.  Mark my words: you simply cannot get any work done on this strain, as you become EXTREMELY FORGETFUL extremely quickly. And it lasts quite a long time, 5+ hours. So that's a HUGE downside. You are literally SO FORGETFUL, you have written off work for the day.  Then why did I give this a 2-3 star? Because it's still stoning. These are CLASSIC stoner effects, gone too far. But the fact is: YOU GET STONED. The problem is - in order to reach a desired level of EUPHORIA, you have to take more of it, and the BODY STONING EFFECTS at that level are TOO HIGH.   So either you don't have euphoria, and have the perfect level of body-stoning, OR you go for the Euphoria and over-shoot the body-stoning, and there are terrible consequences to that. So it's not a well-balanced strain; the body stoning effects are out of whack with the euphoria.  Negative effects are there.  For example:   GENERALISED WEAKENING OF MUSCULATURE: Any muscle feels like it has LESS ENERGY. A lot of the effects below are actually a direct consequence of this.  MASSIVELY DRY EYES. Sounds fun, but soon blinking actually hurts, feels like slight sandpaper, or at least directly causes extreme discomfort.   LOW EYES, sounds fun, but it makes it difficult to see stuff, because you have to spend MASSIVE energy just to open your eyes. How is that fun?  MASSIVE FORGETFULNESS. Sounds fun, until you can't even remember what you were enjoying. This is probably the single biggest flaw of GG#4.  MASSIVELY DRY THROAT, sounds fun, until breathing gets irritating.  I had a PANIC ATTACK on this, accidentally took too much. The entire right side of my chest felt constricted.   The other effects that happened when I got this high were:  FURTHER DECREASED PHYSICAL ENERGY IN MUSCLES. I felt like simply flexing any muscles like biceps or moving fingers in fine movement was TOO MUCH WORK.  CONSTRICTED BLOOD VESSELS in upper body. All my blood vessels felt like my heart had difficulty pumping through them.  DIFFICULTY BREATHING. During my panic attack, in keeping with WEAKENED MUSCLES I had difficulty simply breathing, and my breathing got REALLY SHALLOW. Like almost no chest movement.

I got it for 1.60 a gram during 4:20 so I wasn't expecting any miracles. This flower was 20 percent THC and i've seen it as high as 30. So this was probably middle of the road stuff.   It smelled very sour. One of the most sour of any recent experience. It was a dense and hard bud. Sugar and orange hairs abound.   I took my first light. This log sent dense milky clouds into the pipe immediately. Very fast burning, despite it's density.   The throat hit was immediate and in the words of Nelson from the simpsons - &quot; It tastes like burning &quot; . A very pungent woody and intense burn ... with a sort of grape after taste when it was all over.   The high did live up to its reputation. It was intense and immediate. Right up there with GSC for knock you on your ass level of stoned. I was out of it after the first rip and the second one just sent me even more overboard.   Very psychedelic, dry mouth, eyes, throat. I was pretty much good for nothing. Not sure how i'm going to complete the rest of my night actually.   For me this high was sort of too intense. My paranoia was rampant and it was like a haunted house that I just wanted to escape. I didn't like the place it took me. I was frightened to go downstairs and try and face my family.

My first time trying it I didnt care for it like I do others, it tasted like I licked a home improvement store and really didnâ€™t leave the greatest after taste. Didnt think i would care for it.  Now my 5th time was a much better experience. Each time i try it it grows on me and becomes more rewarding. First hit tasted like beach, ocean front, salty type of outdoor taste but in a good way. It is a pretty heavy hitter but in a timely way, its not a sudden high but a smooth, slow setting high that i feel deep in my chest and upper legs more then anything. Lower legs feel relaxed and feet tingle a little bit.   Im watching Night at the Roxbury for the first time while on this and it doesnt really seem to give me laughing fits that make me crack up. A very relaxing high that has been enjoyable the last few times and doesnt give me dry mouth or dry eyes. I do feel a little anxious but not in a bad way. Doesnt really make me have the munchies but i will say this particular strain makes my stomach feel so calm and normal. Usually i battle lots of gurgling sounds in my stomach and always feels a little upset but not with this strain and lasts the whole next day. My stomach problems dont bother me so even though this is nice its not why i keep trying it.  If i had the choice i probably would pick a couple other strains over it because taste wasnt that great compared to others and although i enjoy what this does for me theres others out there that give me a more pleasant uplifting high, this one feels like a high with little personality if that makes sense.",4,original-glue,0.16615646258503405,0.5124149659863944,True,False,False,0.22,0.02,0.33,-0.45,1.0,199,False,0.07557278558258052,0.19439554595370653,False,True,lack_appetite,False
1526,MagicLady,"It's not called OG for nothing.  GG4 (Gorilla Glue/Original Glue OG Glue) is a hell of a strain! This sucker can put even the most seasoned of stoners down on their ass or perk them right up with an abundance of energy. It's a strong high, but not overwhelmingly so. The worst you might experience is you might fall asleep, or time slows down greatly to you.  I recently purchased GG4 grown by From the Soil at Dank's Wonder Emporium in Lacey, WA and it was certainly worth a go. It's one of those strains you hear older stoners talking about from their youth so you know it's got a good running history. It's a drab sort of green and smells quite pungent, but it has great earthy tones a and strong hints of pine, just perfect for this PNW unicorn. It plants me right on my rump and makes my legs feel like jelly. It makes me kind of a spaz, when I'm not intensely engrossed in whatever I am doing, and gives me a very euphoric and happy trip. Psychedelic stoner rock is amazing to listen to when using GG4.  I would not recommend this to people looking for anxiety relief as I find that my anxiety will still be under the high and I tend to pace the floor, looking for things to clean or organize. Great for depression though. Perks you right up. Overall, I loved it a lot and I will certainly smoke it again and recommend it to anyone who loves a good ol' traditional high.

1529,casual420,"GG4 caught me off-guard in a few ways. The buds are like nothing I've seen before; much more leafy than I expected, when I first received mine, I was worried I might have gotten some cheap shwag that would resemble parsley after grinding. I gave it a rough grind and vaped it. 15 minutes passed, and the effect was so mild, I was convinced I got a bag of ditch weed instead of the premium foliage I was expecting. That's when it started to shift gears. I felt it concentrate in my head in stages: 2nd gear, 5 minute plateau, shift to 3rd gear, 5 minute plateau, shift to 4th gear, 5 minute plateau and finally it shifted into high gear. At that moment (about an hour in), the high trickled down into my body. My head, neck, shoulders and chest got tingly in a nice, relaxed way. It never left my head, it just spread about a bit. After a couple hours, the high concentrated back in my head, and it dipped down to about 1/2 - 2/3 strength, where I enjoyed a nice glow for another hour or two. The effects were surprisingly long-lasting, and for the couple hours peak time, it was as good quality as any high-grade premium I've tried. The smell and taste are consistent and pleasant - piney and earthy, my batch is rather lemony as well. What I thought would be my least favorite strain (or possibly ditch) ended up being one of my favorite smokes yet. 5/5",5,original-glue,0.23213675213675214,0.5595299145299145,True,False,False,0.22,0.02,0.33,-0.45,1.0,175,False,0.19538224705651674,0.161369817639345,True,False,fatigue_headaches,False

1551,GardeningAtNight,"I noticed this strain has gained immense popularity in recent years, mainly due to its very high THC content and level of trichomes. I finally picked some up a few weeks back (long overdue) and this was my experience.  Aroma/Appearance- This stuff smells extremely pungent. Itâ€™s like the stereotypical weed smell but even stronger. Itâ€™s clear to me at this point that this is going to be some dank stuff. By barely touching the buds, my fingers were already sticky. The buds have so many trichomes on them, that it almost looks lightly dusted with snow.  Taste- GG tastes very similar to the smell. Piney, Pungent, and even skunky. Itâ€™s the type of taste that true weed lovers would appreciate immensely.   Effects- Extremely sedating and couch locking. Tingly and Euphoric. In my experience, not energetic and uplifting at all despite dominant sativa origins. I could barely hold a conversation on this stuff.. It made me completely stoned, not high.   Iâ€™ve been smoking weed for a long time, and GG4 is one of the most potent strains Iâ€™ve ever had. I would not recommend this to beginners, as it knocked an experienced vet (me) on my ass.

1641,TheHighMathematician,"I vaped some of this at around 10 pm or so. It took some time to kick in. When it did, I felt a feeling of euphoria. However, that feeling was shortly replaced by a couch lock (or a bed lock in my case). My mind sort of went fuzzy and I couldn't type properly. This was a very unique high. I put on my headphones and decided to watch Avengers: Endgame. As I started the movie, I heard what I thought was my blender running. However, it was just some background noise in the movie. I decided to take my headphones off and watch it with the built-in speakers. I felt quite cold (despite it was summer and I had no AC in my room), so I put a blanket over me. This caused me to feel both hot and cold (if that's even possible). Shortly, I couldn't feel my body at all and quite suddenly, a mild paranoia hit. This didn't last very long, though, and there was no anxiety with it. I also found this high quite isolating (unlike Alaskan Thunder Fuck and Blissful Wizard). I felt like I was in a cocoon drifting in some higher-dimensional space. I got up to get some water but felt gravity multiply. It wasn't unpleasant, though; just went to show the strong effects of the strain on the body. Overall a great experience which was very relaxing and body-focused. Definitely not for beginners, though. The only reason I have given it a 4/5 instead of the full 5/5 is that this high didn't last very long (about an hour or so). Otherwise, a great strain which I'd be willing to try again soon.",4,original-glue,0.07157738095238096,0.5616666666666666,True,False,False,0.22,0.02,0.33,-0.45,1.0,174,False,0.7744102136747729,0.14531945105535712,True,False,muscle_spasms,False

1645,Heshianpriest,"This is a very fabled strain for me that I sought after for a long time. About a year ago on a work trip my coworker offered to smoke me out after a long day of work. As he is packing the bowl I smelled the strong and pungent odor and instantly new it was dank. I asked what strain and he responded â€œOG Glue aka GG4 aka Larry Birdâ€ù. First bong hit in and I am super lifted. The stress and sore muscles of the long day evaporated. We smoked all of his glue that day!   Months and months pass and I dream of the high from that day. It hit like when I first started blazing years and years ago. To my surprise that friend texts me saying he has come across the legendary Glue again! I picked up close to an ounce!  This is a super potent indica with dense, soft, hazy white, and crumbly buds. This strain is both a super potent medicinally as well as recreationally relaxing strain. Most strains donâ€™t make me giddy or excited these days and this one does. I would ad if used sparingly it works well for anxiety/depression. Personally I want to get the full effect so this is perfect after a long day of work or a stoned out weekend!

1802,GanjaGoddess410,"Genetics: â€œThe White Widow strain was first released to the public by Shantibaba, shortly after he founded the Green House Seed Company in 1994 with a Dutch partner named Arjan. The pedigree of this famous sativa/indica hybrid is made up of a pure Brazilian sativa mother and a South Indian, Keralan hybrid father. The exact origins of the mother plant remains somewhat of a mystery but the most educated guess is that it could possibly be the old school, Brazilian landrace Manga Rosa, which has a long history of spiritual use. The Father was discovered during a trip to India where Shantibaba was approached by a man, who after sharing a joint with him, eventually led him to his farm in the mountains of Kerala. The farmer then introduced him to an indica hybrid that had been selectively cultivated and bred towards optimum resin production in his village for a very long time. After several days of sampling the farmerâ€™s plants, Shantibaba left for the Netherlands with a batch of fresh seeds, from which he was soon to discover the male for his White Widow cross. He eventually bred it to the Brazilian Sativa mother, forming the spectacular White Widow.â€ù    http://www.seedsman.com/en/origins-of-white-widow/      Smell: Buttery is a good word to describe the taste of this strain. It also smells a bit sweet, and has a strong piney, earthy-ish smell as well.  You could compare the smell to a very sweet and creamy butter, with a strong background scent of pine.  The smell is ridiculously unique. I guarantee that you will never smell another strain like it. So, take a big whiff before itâ€™s gone!           Taste: It has a very rich and delicious taste that practically melts in your mouth, but the taste of pine is strong as well. It could not be mistaken for any other strain.  The taste is almost identical to the smell, but maybe a bit more earthy and piney than buttery. To get the full effect of how tasty White Widow can be, try putting a small piece of a nug on your tongue, and let it sit there for 30 seconds or so. I had chocolate ice cream with this strain in it, and when I tasted it, chocolate was the second flavor I tasted.  Usually chocolate overpowers most other flavors, but not White Widow.       Effects: (Keep in mind that my tolerance is ridiculously high, therefore the effects I feel may be less than what a person with a normal tolerance would feel from this strain.) Itâ€™s the best of both worlds. Itâ€™s 60% Sativa, which gives you a head-high, and 40% Indica, which gives you a body-high. In my experience with this strain, I felt as if it were more like 50/50 and not 40/60. You could definitely feel the silly, happy, high feeling that Sativa strains give you, but you also feel calm, relaxed, and even pretty sleepy from the Indica part of it.  Personally, it made me feel a bit more tired than I would have liked, but it didnâ€™t put me to sleep completely. I got some very nice visuals from this strain.         What Medical Conditions it Helps With: Anxiety- I smoke this strain when I feel a panic attack coming on.  After a couple hits it slowly calms you down to a point where the anxiety or panicky feelings are completely gone. Depression- I think many strains help with depression, but usually Sativa dominant strains help with depression but not anxiety. Itâ€™ll make you very silly, and youâ€™ll laugh at everything, no matter how sad you are before smoking. Physical Pain- In my opinion, this is a wonderful strain for any type of physical pain, including chronic pain. Especially because most strains that help with chronic pain will give you couch-lock..which sucks if you want to be pain-free but also able to do things. Insomnia- This strain will help with mild insomnia. If you have it bad, I suggest a more indica dominant strain. Creativity- Not a medical condition, but it does make you very creative!          Similar Strains: Ice. Ice is a 50/50 strain that is similar to White Widow in effects.  I enjoyed both of them very much. White Widow is a bit better quality, but Ice is great as well.      What the Buds Look Like: The nugs look like little pinecones, and are small in size. They are covered in a nice layer of trichomes and resin, which is mostly white and light green. The hairs on the bud are a light shade of amber.  The leaves tangle around the nugs, making them look even more aesthetically pleasing. The buds are frosty and coated in trichomes if you break them open and look inside. It is some very good looking bud, in my opinion.      I would suggest smoking it in: A bong or a bubbler. You can only really do this strain justice if you smoke it in glass piece. It has a very interesting taste. If you roll it in a joint or a blunt, you wonâ€™t be able to taste it as well.  I personally liked it rolled into joints as well, but my friends and I came to a consensus that it is much better in a pieceâ€_preferably a water piece. A bowl or vaporizer would be good as well. On a side note, it is a wonderful strain to put in edibles. My friend made a batch of lemon pound cake with this in it, and it tasted great!      (This was a review I posted previously on Tumblr.

1817,TSmoove,"My 1st time trying this strain and it was a pure RUSH to the dome piece! I initially did not like it... However, an exclaiming WOW factor! It felt like Chuck Norris kicked me in the head, right in the area where my sinuses are located. I then felt this heaviness over my eyes. Kinda like a rollercoaster ride when it get to its climbing height and releases down that gut wrenching hill at such a fast pace. The pressure that hits ur head is how this felt. Sitting in the house not doing anything was making the experience an unpleasant one. Low and behold, I stepped out on my patio and it was like OMG! I heard nature like never before. Every sound was amplified! I watched birds and listened to them like never before. It started to drizzle very lightly, but I saw the small fragile rain drops. Man! What a great feeling after the headiness subsided! I even found serenity during a brief moment of meditation. Then, when I came back in the house, I became very energetic. Through on some jazz and off I went around the house. I was even able to focus better on some school work / studying! My piece of advice: Find a place to relax and allow ur mind to open up. Enjoy being out in nature or turn on some relaxing music. Allow ur mind to travel and just listen! After that heavy head feeling goes away, find something you'd like to do and get busy doing it. Ur levels of creativity will soar, as well as ur energy levels! Great Stuff!

1827,u420,"I've been smoking for a long time, first recreationally and then medicinally. There are a number of legendary strains that I've wanted to try. Matinuska Thunder Fuck, Pineapple Express, Maui Wowie, OG Kush, Granddaddy Purple and White Widow. Up until recently, I had tried all but White Widow. I tried a strain that was supposed White Widow but had almost none of the reported effects. Then I found some at Northwest Health Center LLC in PDX. This strain seems to be hard to find, considering it's reputation. The buds are light/dark mottled green with orange hairs. I wouldn't call it frosty by any means. I needed magnification to see the crystals. The buds are not sticky at all and are a little woody. The smell is of pine but not very strong. Considering what I've read about the frosty, sticky, stinky qualities of this strain, I don't believe I got the best sample. Grinding was easy with little remaining material in the grinder. Vaping at 380 produced a heavy vapor, but it didn't make me want to cough. Effects started off slowly with a little uplifted and spacey feeling. Thoughts are not difficult with this strain and good conversations are possible and even enhanced. I was happy and boarderline giggly. It completely cleared up my nausea for about three hours, which is a fantistic duration for me. This is a active strain and not a couch-lock one. It didn't affect my ability to go to sleep when I went to bed, however. I didn't experience any anxiety or paranoia. This strain has some nifty indica effects as well in that it significantly helped control my lower back pain and muscle spasms. This would be a good strain for almost anything, relieving pain, nausea, anxiety, depression, stress, etc. Since the strength was strong even in a lower quality sample, I imagine a high quality sample would knock my socks off. Even the sample I tried has brought this strain into my top five. A good quality sample  might make number one. I intend to continue searching for, and sampling this strain whenever possible. -si",5,white-widow,0.15143939393939393,0.5172960372960372,True,False,False,0.2623026284778013,0.032635074263565905,0.7999589481392972,0.5299680511786401,0.44525646172735533,23,True,0.7139122664745445,0.15175547155620733,False,True,cramps,False

Especially with the beautiful white scenery in this year's winter, the euphoria and extreme happiness/tingling from this strain gave a beautiful outlook to everything and promoted random but beautiful ideas. Immediate cure for a rough day/week/life.

It felt good but nothing to write home about. If I had some or a friend had some and said letâ€™s go smoke I wouldnâ€™t be looking forward to it as much as other strains.  I didnâ€™t feel the euphoria or as happy as some other strains but it was relaxing and I did feel uplifted.

I give it 3 stars as I would smoke it again if someone offered me some and overall itâ€™s fine but I wouldnâ€™t be going out and buying it again.  I was smoking this in bud form and from a pipe.

And so on, one rainy evening after eveninglessons i said to a friend of me, who did not smoke, i wanted to smoke.  So after school we went to the coffeeshop, bought a gram of white widowÂ and rolled a fat joint.  Stupid enough to smoke the whole joint, i did, and at first it wasn't that bad.  Strong euphoric high, big wide smile on my face and far from couch-locked.  I where even able to catch te bus for my friend so he could get home!  So there i'm standing, alone with 0.5 gram of hard lessons to never forget,Â i continued to smoke.Â   Walked inside the train station, stil smoking and starting to get quite uncomfortable.   Actually you can say i began to get badshit paranoid, trew my small leftover away and noticed people looking.  Maby they weren't looking, maybe did.  Constantly repeating the question, i found myself unable to find my train...  Wondering around, paranoia and the devastating high beginning to tear my mind lose from my brain, i saw i had my phone in my hand, and my friend who left a hour ago was calling me.Â   Picking up the callÂ i heard his voice slightly panicked, asking where i am,Â i looked around and said: &quot;no Idea, Bram&quot;.  At that moment my phone died.  Trying to keep my shit togetherÂ i continued wondering around, whatever world my high ass was cast at,Â i sad down on a bench on the station.  Noticing i fell in anÂ intens deep trance,Â i stood up and for what ever reason got in the first train i saw. The wrong one obviously.  But in whatever wayÂ god creates wonders, my friend was there outside the window!  I sprinted outside the train and almost body slammed my 120 kg weighing friend against the floor whenÂ i hugged him and maby even let a tear of releave.

White Widow is my favorite &quot;get it done strain&quot;. It's uplifting like a sativa, but still has a little bit of body high and relaxing effect (just a tiny amount though). It seems like what the perfect Sativa should be to me. I consider it a sativa as far as effects, but not way too clean like some sativas. It's still more clear headed than Durban Poison, and Vortex and some other &quot;stony&quot; Sativas. White Widow is even more clear headed than Mau Waui, which is also a Sativa. Which is also White Widow's only downside; it doesn't really get you relaxed and sleepy before bed, it's not good for insomina like a good indica such as UW Purple or Pitbull. And the stony Sativas I listed above would be better than this before bed.

The last White Widow review that I submitted was for a product grown by Canaca, but last week I noticed that OCS managed to grab a competitors version so I had to get some for a head to head comparison. This new batch I got was grown by Redecan, who's White Shark and Shiskaberry I've already tried. I'm not going to go over what I expect from a White Widow strain you can check my previous review for that, instead I'm just doing to discuss how this brand of White Widow compares to Canaca's.

1909,Tones06,"Bought a HQ off the OCS website. 18.8%THC  First impressions: The scent isn't as dank as I thought. Light on the nose, earthy and slight pine. 4 large nugs, not tightly wound, but still dense. Thick flakes at the bottom as a result from shifting in transport.  At first, the bud itself is looks like it isn't dusted in trichomes, but under a bright light you can see it is dusted like fine powder all over. The pistils are a solid dark copper colour which are tightly wound in and out of the bud.   The blaze: Smooth. No cough reflex, the high starts with the head. You might get a little giggly or even find mundane things funny. But suddenly your thoughts wane to another thought and idea. I feel like the focus flows like a leaf down a stream. And that's when you notice the body tingles which really helps if you have inflammation or tense muscles. At this point your body feels like warm butter, the indica side starts to kick in.

I wasn't overly impressed with this strain when I tried the flower but that was probably due to my own THC tolerance. THIS was very nice. It starts off with a gentle easiness in the eyes and just spreads throughout the body with time. The physical effect isn't one that leaves you feeling tired, just feeling relaxed and good. Mentally, I feel happy and much more carefree than I did half an hour ago. Like the physical effects, this is gentle and not excessively intense like some sativas can get. I can now totally understand why so many people love this strain.

The smell is pungent with a pronounced fuel and lime aroma. The taste is light, earthy, almost woodsy, with a mellow, sweet-bark and hash aftertaste. The smoke is curious, some hits are super-smooth and others have more bite, not just in the lungs but the throat as well. The high is interesting, too. Itâ€™s heady but not so invigorating like some sativas (Durban poison or Green Crack, for example). Itâ€™s mostly just an incredible ability to focus. The body buzz, which sets in about a hot minute after, is relaxing but not intense . I have a heightened sense of awareness and contentment. Not a lot of pain relief, so look for other strains for that, just a feeling of well-being. This could be used to clean the house, create artwork or music, go on a nature walk or enjoy a conversation with good friends.

It had an awesome taste and smoked from my new pipe soooo smoothly! After taking it slow with a few deep tokes, I instantly got that familiar sweet high I last experienced 30 years ago! A pleasant laid back chill with absolutely no paranoia. A fantastic choice I won't forget, and I am so glad this strain was my reintroduction to getting high again!

2064,OCWeedReview,"After the release of the popular stoner flick by the same name, many people assumed that Pineapple Express was a fictional strain, but the truth is it is a very real bud, a cross between Trainwreck and Hawaiian, both heavily influenced by sativa genes.  It is this background that makes Pineapple Express such a popular strain.  The jubilant sativa high can completely change your day and is very different from the mostly indica based strains popular on market.  You will want this medication in your life, and you will become giddy when you see it on a menu.    Pineapple Express is a shiny bud, bright with trichromes, making for a pale green bud.  Juxtaposed against this pastel flower are orange hairs grouped in thick clumps.  When I broke it up, a fine layer of kief was left on the bottom of my dish, speaking to the number of crystals covering these buds.  The smell of this strain is sweet and succulent and lingered on my fingers long after I handled it.  There is a mouth watering effect when the tropical aroma is deeply inhaled.  While pineapple is assumed, it is more mango and pear: both luscious and juicy.  Tearing into this bud is like ripping into an off-the-branch-fresh fruit.  The flavor, although sweet in the green hit, is astringent in the exhale and can be harsh.  This can be the case with some sativas types.    Although Pineapple Express has some Afghani indica in its Trainwreck heritage, this is a predominantly sativa high.  Itâ€™s been touted as the happiest of highs--completely relaxed and carefree.  Medicating with Pineapple Express is a bit like going on vacation.  Even though it is mellow and cheerful, there is little chance you are going to get much work done.  This strain is distracting, and I had a hard time achieving much of anything.  It is much better enjoyed when responsibility can be shelved and the high can truly be enjoyed.  Iâ€™d strongly recommend this strain as an effective antidepressant.  It helps you forget yourself and unwind.  In todayâ€™s hectic world, it can be your stolen moment to center yourself.  http://ocweedreview.wordpress.com/",3,pineapple-express,0.18377083333333336,0.502375,True,False,False,0.2780878164634146,0.003370595221036574,0.17469397640312423,0.059583863926064407,0.7836288007503225,34,True,0.7294912843805732,0.1827018638103802,False,True,depression,False

For quite some time (being a small town New Yorker) the name thing didn't mean anything to me, and the movie was great, but I didn't realize it was an actual bud. So I got it.

However, it is in shatter form, and a little dark in color, but as a new &quot;dabber&quot; this has been a great strain for me to learn with and just enjoy. I did take a dab before I started writing this, and the high is definitely a creeper high. Took ~5-10 minutes for full effect, and now I'm just stoked on life. Sipping some coffee and lounging around as I get ready for the day (first day of online classes) I can tell this strain will not affect my energy levels (not sedating/drowsy) but will keep me extremely focused and beyond joyous. It's definitely a feel good, happy high that I can enjoy time and time again. I would recommend this to anyone ever. Maybe just start with some flower, cz this shatter is bomb.

Because at first glance the bud seems a little bland if I might say, but once you break it open and smell that sweet smell and feel the resin sticking to you're fingers you know what you're in for.  It has a real earthy sweet taste to it and it burns quiet well in a bong, nice thick clouds. It's pretty hard hitting but you instantly feel it flush from you head down, droopy eyes are what a lot of my friends that have smoke it have said. It's a pretty lazy high as well.

2080,LeMangeLumiere,"I cannot say enough about this strain. Holy shit. This is my new favorite strain. I got a gram of this for free as a first-time patient at a local dispensary, and I am SO glad I grabbed this instead of the Indica I was looking at right next to it.  For one thing, the smell and flavor are on point. Pineapple Express lives up to its tropical, fruity-sounding name; each hit brought a strong taste of a tropical fruit cocktail, with earthy/woody undertones to even out some of the sweetness. It hits VERY smoothly (through a bong at least), and is an all-around pleasant smoke. Typically I like to vent my room well after I smoke weed, since the smell can linger a bit much, but I don't mind the lingering scent of this strain; it really is quite sweet and fruity. Reminds me of smoking cannabis in paradise!  When I smoked this, I smoked it out of the relatively large bowl of my brand-new bong. I'd only smoked out of it once before, and I only smoked maybe half a bowl, since that's all I had left in my grinder at the time. It was some God's Gift, so it hit me pretty fast and knocked me out; was a great high though, and that being my first time ever smoking out of a bong and having such a great experience, I was super excited to try this new strain (a popular one of Hollywood fame) for the first time using a bong. It was Friday night, after work, and Friday nights are usually my stoner nights where I get high and let my stress of the week burn away with the bowl... therefore, I packed a pretty full bowl.  The bowl wasn't even finished and I was gone. And by gone, I mean off in another dimension, another pocket of time separate from that of the rest of the world. One minute seemed like ten, it seemed like I was floating in a blissful, carefree cloud. My body was totally relaxed, but my mind was active, flying free. It. Felt. Amazing. I was completely separated from my pain, completely separated from the stress of the work week. I was existing in my own little paradise without a care in the world (which is absolutely, insanely remarkable considering how I am usually in a constant state of anxiety over everything ever). I pushed myself to polish off the bowl and I am so glad I did, because this feeling only grew. I was super fucking high. Probably too high, but I didn't have that &quot;too high&quot; feeling. I just felt great.  Another thing that was absolutely amazing about the high produced by this strain is that it stimulated my imagination to the point of extreme clarity. Like... I'm talking VIVID visualization. Not hallucination or anything like that (I had complete control over what I was picturing as well), but if I tried imagining something, the image or sensation would come to me very easily and very clearly. I do practice witchcraft as part of my spirituality, and visualization is a very important part of this. I feel that smoking some of this could easily bring my practice to new heights. I also absolutely would like to get a &quot;stoner journal&quot; for when I smoke strains like this, because just lying on my bed I came up with some pretty amazing creative writing/fantasy story ideas, and I would LOVE to be able to write them down and revisit them when I'm sober instead of just telling my boyfriend to remember them for me. Things just... came to life in my mind. Seriously. I cannot get over how vividly I was able to imagine visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli.  Which brings me to the next part of my review...  ***MATURE CONTENT, POSSIBLE TMI FOLLOWING***  This is DEFINITELY going to be one of my go-to sex strains. Idk if anyone else has experienced this while smoking this strain, and maybe it was a mix of the high and my hormones being a bit out-of-whack... but along with that vivid imagery and visualization came a WHOLE lot of horniness. Of course I started thinking about a sexual dream I'd had the night before (and previously masturbated to) and it came back in vivid detail, both visually and in terms of practically being able to feel certain parts of my body being touched... Long story short, I had the BEST masturbation session I think I've ever had. I have never come so much in my life. I told my boyfriend about it (we're long distance at the moment) and he said he'd be open to possibly bringing cannabis into the bedroom after I described my experience; he's previously been pretty hesitant about it.  ***END MATURE CONTENT/TMI***  On top of all this, I don't think I experienced a single negative side effect. The high was unrivaled; when I started to come down I did get a bit tired, but it didn't hit me like a ton of bricks like it does with some strains. It just relaxed me enough for me to ease into bed and float off pleasantly to sleep. I had some pretty interesting dreams (actually interesting, like fun) and ended up sleeping VERY well and waking up feeling more refreshed than I've felt in a while. A lot of times when I wake up I feel like I hardly slept at all, even if I slept for 10+ hours; that was NOT the case after going to bed with this in my system. I slept very well, slept in, and woke up feeling totally rejuvenated and in an amazing mood. Best Saturday I've had in forever. I wish I felt this way every morning. Perhaps I'm going to have to make a nighttime ritual of smoking a generous bowl of Pineapple Express...  But yeah. Absolutely mind-blowing strain. If you want to create your own little slice of paradise with your high, you MUST pick this up. Every cannabis user should try some of this at least once in their lifetime.",5,pineapple-express,0.20885015716411068,0.5751724610445541,True,False,False,0.2780878164634146,0.003370595221036574,0.17469397640312423,0.059583863926064407,0.7836288007503225,199,True,0.6981937616191057,0.024233590182546474,False,True,seizures,True

2083,Monaliza,"All aboard the Pineapple Express, Sativa-Hybrid by Cresco!  â€œWelcome home dearâ€ù is my first thought as my younger lips touched the cart tip. Pineapple Express is a return to old times, longer days, family picnics and when all lead wasnâ€™t â€˜badâ€™.   With its linage in Trainwrek (Mexican, Thai &amp; Afghani) and Hawaiian, Pineapple Express is a strong sativa leaning Hybrid strain that knocks both your ass and your mind clear out of your body.  For me, a morning and afternoon train ride only.   Hereâ€™s the juice:  Cresco  #Cresco Yeltrah 500 mg CO2 cartridge from #TerraVida Holistic Centers THC: 63.48% THCA: 1.28% CBG: 0.87%  Daâ€™ Terps:  Terpinolene: 1.39% Anise, Ginger  Myrcene: 0.73% Lemongrass, Hops Limonene: 0.38% Lemon, Juniper  Pineapple Express is celebrated for calming muscle spasms, pain, depression, social anxiety- releaf and euphoria. It is not known for being able to accomplish tasks or meet deadlines.  Pineapple does not belong on pizza. But, when you open up and let the train in, smoked pineapple will become your new conductor of love. The first vapor drawn in unfolds a lightly snowed landscape with scattered pines and juniper bushes. Grilled pineapple skews your senses as it builds into a peppered tropical fruit salad in your mouth. *swallows* At the midpoint, anise and nutmeg flirt with hops and lime to round out the flavorful exhaust. You are left with fumes of lime accompanied by fallen corpses of over-toasted marshmallows on the damp forest floor.   Pineapple Express is a fantastic medicine for staying cheerful, happy, smiley, calm and awake.   Letâ€™s make it a party!  I will be pairing Pineapple Express with cranberry seltzer over muddled raspberry ice cubes. For a nosh, dim sum styled service of pickled vegetables, spicy cabbage brisket and thick- cut pieces of rosemary herbed roasted potatoes. To finish, a dollop of amaretto whipped cream sits akimbo a slab of bittersweet chocolate cheesecake bringing me back down to my knees. All aboard!  Thank You for reading. I hope you enjoyed it.  _Ÿ’_ Be Kynd to One Another _Ÿ’™  _Ÿ’_ _Ÿçç_Ÿ__ _Ÿ’œ",5,pineapple-express,0.1883644133644133,0.4882090132090132,True,False,False,0.2780878164634146,0.003370595221036574,0.17469397640312423,0.059583863926064407,0.7836288007503225,199,True,0.6981937616191057,0.024233590182546474,False,True,inflamation_insomnia,False

The flavor is very fruity and sweet and the smoke is very smooth and becomes smoother with water filtration. This is a perfect smoke for any time of the day as it will not give you a heavily sedated feeling that occurs with indicas and high CBD strains. You can very easy accomplish your goals for the day on this strain and it certainly makes me more social and chatty with the strangers I encounter about my day. The color of the nugs is usually bright green with bright orange hairs, the colors really pop on these flows so beware dull and dark strains as they are not the real deal.

2105,CaliMamaPNW,"I have pretty severe anxiety and depression; Iâ€™m currently treating my anxiety with Zoloft, and while it works well for that, it honestly doesnâ€™t do much for my depression. I started my cannabis journey with CBD, hoping to help with my PMDD, and fell down a rabbit hole. Ringoâ€™s Gift, Sour Tsunami, and Remedy were godsends. I eventually decided to venture further into higher THC strains, but had a really hard time finding one that didnâ€™t send my anxiety off on a rocket. One day, while in a dispensary that isnâ€™t my usual, I saw Pineapple Express for $2 a gram. I remembered reading about it being really great for depression, so I decided to give it a shot.  I am SO glad I did.  When I vape it (I use an Atmos Jump), it is like a moderate sedative. My eyes get heavy, my face relaxes, and the part of my brain that is forever thinking negative thoughts just chills the fuck out and lets me enjoy things. I get negligible to no anxiety. My mood just completely changes. I can sleep, but I can also start a task and complete it (which is extra awesome because I also have ADD and it can make life miserable). I sometimes use it throughout the day (when I know I wonâ€™t be driving) and Iâ€™m able to stay calmly productive, and pretty much take things in stride. I feel so NORMAL. Except, you know, high lol.

2126,GardeningAtNight,"Where to begin..... This is a legendary strain! So much has already been said about Pineapple Express. I was lucky enough to finally try this strain recently, and I must say, my expectations were sky high- mainly due to claims like â€œHands down the dopest dope Iâ€™ve ever smoked.â€ù  Aroma- To me, Pineapple Express has a floral/fruity smell. The name itself makes a lot of sense, and given this strains origins(Hawaiian/Trainwreck), I figured it would smell tropical. I wouldnâ€™t say Pineapple is specifically apparent in the smell, but it definitely has a sweet smell.  Taste- Sweet and Tropical. Truly great. The flavor is much more general than pineapple, as hints of citrus and other tropical fruits are present in my experience.  Effects- With my few experiences, the best way to describe the effects is that it is a mood booster. I didnâ€™t feel very energized after smoking it like I saw some people suggest, but it didnâ€™t make me tired either. The high itself is well balanced. Not overly euphoric but enough to be satisfied. I had a fairly clear mind, and was able to hold conversations fine. Pineapple Express seems to be a versatile experience, as it can help you unwind without feeling very tired.   Overall, Pineapple Express has a fantastic taste and aroma, while leaving you with a solid, well balanced high. I canâ€™t say â€œItâ€™s the dopest dope Iâ€™ve ever smokedâ€ù, but I was nonetheless pleased with my experiences.

2136,Hempnesi,"Pineapple Express from Cresco Labs is available in PA and is an instant favorite for me. This strain boasts the high levels of terpinolene (citrus, gassy, tropical, sweet) I'm always after. The flower, CO2 &amp; Liquid Live Resin products are phenomenal and consistent across board with each batch and over the products available with this strain.   Regardless of the grower, and the processors, this strain is easily recognizable. It will hit you fast at any potency but the initial intensity will not last too long, so don't worry if you feel it quite a bit and have somewhere to be. It will accumulate in your sinuses and may be slightly harsh or tickle the throat if you prefer more floral and softer flavors. It will relax you and give you that dry, soft comfortable feeling with growing, lasting flavors behind your nose and on your taste buds after you put it down. Great for relaxing the body a little bit, resolving away muscle pain and soreness but will allow your mind and creativity to flow.   This strain will melt away stressful thoughts and anxiety and leave you happy and open to socializing.

Taste: Definitely closer to the flower in a joint than most vape companies truly go but I'm a terp girl so a little more pineapple kick would be cool. Very natural taste just like they promised. 1.5/2 Star.  Feel: One sneaky mf. We laughed at the absurdity of pants.

It was a treat but one puff set me down good, a little too good for a daily strain. Not a functional high but enjoyable. Didn't make me hungry but great for some treat yo self dining. 1.75/2 Stars.

As someone who suffers from panic disorders, I always wanted to try this strain but thought it may have too much of a paranoia factor for me. I saw how pretty this batch of buds was at my local dispensary and was talked into trying it by a bud-tender there.   Iâ€™m so glad I tried it! Although I donâ€™t use it super often, itâ€™s such a good strain when I want to clean or just have that extra boost of energy and euphoria that makes my day just a little better. Itâ€™s a good one to smoke in the morning or the early afternoon, I love how it tastes the most!   I rate this classic strain 4.2/5 overall, flavor is a 4.5/5 for me and the appearance is a 4/5.

2214,Nik_Nak,"Iâ€™m not a big fan of sativa because Iâ€™m pretty sensitive to just about any kind of medicine. I go through all the reviews or most of them before I try a new bud and Iâ€™m usually grouped in with that ONE person who said they got paranoid with it or something weird. Thatâ€™s me, Iâ€™m that sensitive. It gave me restless legs, a little anxiety, and kept me up ALL night. I smoked it @8p (not a good idea).  With that being said, the high was great!! The bud smells sweet and the smoke doesnâ€™t burn. Itâ€™s a very light and fluffy weed, sticky and a little hard to break apart with your fingers. Donâ€™t let the softness of the high fool you because this stuff lasts for hours; I didnâ€™t smoke much, maybe a small bowl of it, and the high itself lasted over 4 hours. It came on a little slow and steady and smooth, a delicious cerebral high. Very VERY creative, really had my musical juices flowing. I was making music in my head, adding in instruments one at a time and hearing each layer as theyâ€™re being added in my mind, hearing the beautiful bass, it was amazing. I would have to say thatâ€™s the most creative Iâ€™ve felt in that capacity with any other bud.   Pretty sure it made me horny, too, but I had also smoked some blueberry a couple hours later when I was trying to get my body to wind down, so that couldâ€™ve been it too.   I am going to try this for a wake and bake. Itâ€™s a light enough sativa where youâ€™ll feel some energy but not too hyper (unless you smoke more than Iâ€™d did youâ€™ll probably feel like you took a mild energy drink). Itâ€™ll relax you as well. Itâ€™s a great happy, hopeful, creative, letâ€™s get into some fun shit, bud. Perfect sativa strain!  Enjoy!

Intense fruity, woodsy, slight spice aromas. A bit dry, but not bad...broke up pretty good. Smoke was smooth, yet expanding and the flavor on the exhale very fruity. Pineappley? Maybe more tropical. Definitely a good smoke. ... left me feeling all over good. My PTSD symptoms were relieved and I was able to continue on with my day.

I've held off on this review for about a year because I wasn't sure if I was just not getting the most optimal use out of Pineapple Express but I've come to find that this one just isn't for me but could be for others.  For me this is a bubbly high; it's like the light beer of the liquor world and that it takes a very large amount of it to get me feeling anything 'worthwhile'. However, Pineapple Express being a hybrid I do have to praise it for being precisely in the middle of that spectrum. The balance struck is perfect should one be looking for an afternoon delight as it should leave you in above moderate condition.  Having the pleasure of enjoyed this through flower and vape carts I can firmly say that the flavor is incredibly tropically fruity. I'd argue a more banana taste over a pineapple one but it doesn't detract from the enjoyment.  Tl;dr: A fine strain for a beginner or average user to get them through a light afternoon.

2419,spacejunkOG,"Trainwreck has almost mythical genetic origins, and a few different accounts of where &amp; when the strain was first bred.  In recent years this previously &quot;clone-only&quot; strain was purchased by Greenhouse Seeds, and provided in seed form on the open market globally.  Many people argue that the &quot;real&quot; strain, which supposedly originated in Arcata, California, is not what you get when you buy it from a seed company, and is *only* available in clone form via trusted growers' networks.  The seed company claims to have simply inbred the clone, to provide an exact replica of the original strain.  The flowering time on trainwreck is also hugely debated and even more shrouded in mystery - which adds to some very different batches of trainwreck - harvested on the late side, you can very easily be stuck on the couch with this stuff.  harvested on the early side with the right environmental factors you could be writing a Physio paper.  Regardless of which phenotype you get, I have never encountered or grown a version of Trainwreck that didn't have the distinctive SPICY, overpowering smell which to me is indicative of the South / Central American genetics that are prevalent in the strain and which I believe lend to its tall, lanky, very sativa-like leaf / branch structure (the flowers, on the other hand, tend to be ubiquitous clusters of relatively small popcorn buds, which are usually highly resinous and sparkling with glass-shard-sized trichomes by mid-flower).

2429,Smoke206,"Trainwreck is one of my favorite strains so far. I wouldn't so much say that it hits you like a trainwreck, but it definitely does creep up on you after awhile. I'd say it takes 15/30 minutes before you realize you're high. Then, it only gets higher from there. I've found it hits me in stages. But, the feeling of relaxation starts about 15 minutes in. I feel it just wash over me in entirety, and it just makes me feel peaceful, happy, and relaxed. Perfect to come home to after a long or stressful day. For me, the smoke is quite smooth. I'm normally a cougher, as I have asthma, so I find smoking is pretty rough - not this. I'm able to take bigger, deeper hits, without coughing my brains out. I've noticed that it takes awhile to fully knock me out, aka get me to a sleep state. Probably within a couple hours? It does knock me out for a good 4 - 5 hours of sleep, where I'll be dead to the world. Haven't been able to sleep longer than that on it so far, regardless of how much I smoke of it. It doesn't make me super ravenously hungry, but I do crave certain foods about 45 minutes in. Something salty, or sweet usually. I normally smoke out of a water bong, filled with ice/cold water.

You start to think â€œHey that bad shit thatâ€™s happening, fuck it, thats life manâ€ù. THIS IS WHAT BEING HIGH IS SUPPOSED TO FUCKING FEEL LIKE! Everything in life is better and different but life is so good, that you cNâ€™t even remember what its like when ur not high, it just feels like youâ€™ve always felt this way and you always will feel this way. You can also function with this strain! You might even find yourself being able to talk to people better or think clearer! Itâ€™s like god hand bred the strain himself!Also, I know a lot of people smoke to avoid alertness and sleep BUT this strain makes it so you can sleep if u want or stay awake if u choose. You feel so in control. So far Iâ€™ve had my bf and my friends all try it and they agreed its the best strain. Its god damn perfection. If you smoke enough, IT WILL FEEL LIKE YOUR FIRST TIME GETTING HIGH! Heavy weed smokers, occasional users, newbies, this shit doesnâ€™t discriminate against anyone man. (Note, I have been smoking Tropical Train wreck carts from supreme rather train wreck alone but from the other reviews Iâ€™ve been reading, Train wreck is outstanding on its own.)   *One more thing, if you smoke this shit RIGHT before you sleep, youâ€™ll get SUPER realistic dreams. Theyâ€™re not ALWAYS gold dreams but even when theyâ€™re bad the experience is so fucking dope and the dreams are never intense enough to the point where you canâ€™t sleep.

Taste like old school weed to me usually smooth nice lung expansion with  inhale noticeably more lemon and pine taste on exhale if ur lucky to get a good batch it will have a slight menthol hint at the end,4,trainwreck,0.40972222222222215,0.5375,True,False,False,0.269984928,0.0025924685076923076,0.11678488635383022,0.5992245035188551,0.526391838905593,126,False,0.2482453360872362,0.10980256502154205,True,False,pain,True

The first was described by my dealer at the time as a heavy, caffeinating sativa and heavy and caffeinating, it was. After smoking, I dutifully cleaned my friend's entire apartment and made slutty brownies. Then sat down to write some music. The entire time, I enjoyed a steady stream of lively, intense thinking. One of the most sativa-y sativas I've had to this day.   Since then, I've only ever had hybrids and sativa-dom hybrids from rec stores called Trainwreck and it's been good, but not as good. It's thought-provoking, but not thought-inspiring. I feel creative, but I don't quite have the energy to act on it. It's still great for music, sex, taking walks, sensory experiences, movies/tv. It's pretty euphoric and heady but somewhat low energy.

Turning my tale to paper and pen would conjure my plight out of the abstract thought, into reality, and concrete its status as Incontrovertible Truth, viewable by all who may read my words.   That night... there are flashes of rushing red against a dark grey wall that halved the part of the world that was lit. I understood later that I had fallen. No, if I am to believe my friendâ€™s account, I leaped of my own volition.   We were engaged in games of prestidigitation, the atmosphere immediate to our faces shifting, the buzzing light above shining through layers of smoke as we sipped from generously filled, expertly rolled cigarillos. It was of the highest quality, medical grade, well worth the extra expenditure of funds out of pocket. It was a new strain, rolled out with fanfare by our resident pusher.   Trainwreck BX2.   I had to pause a moment for itâ€™s the first Iâ€™ve dared utter its name outside the confines of my nightmares. When I came to, shaking myself from my stupor like a wet dog, hours had passed and yet the storm hasnâ€™t abated, seeming to increase in ferocity the faster I wrote.   I leaped face-first into the concrete. My friend was reasonably freaked. When I came to, all red below my nose, currently queerly shaped, I took my phone and calmly ordered for pizza in a pool of my own blood. When it arrived, the blood had congealed and I was able to sit up, becoming sufficiently restored after the pizza to continue our cardfoolery.   Trainwreck...  Please, donâ€™t allow my tortured account to lead you to believe that this strain is as monstrous or powerful as I make it out to be; I had neglected to imbibe enough water. And itâ€™s true I dally in reacquainting myself with this strain, but itâ€™s only because of the forgetful nature that comes with being a connoisseur.

2581,SebadohGPB,The first time I smoked this strain was about a year and a half ago. I was sitting in my room with a few shirts over my lamp so my room was dark and comfortable. I went outside and pulled some gravity bongs with a big Arizona gallon jug and a bucket inside of the abandoned house across from me. I was laying in my bed enjoying her effects and relaxing to the sound of my favorite band... Sebadoh. I saw small faint outlines of color lining the boards in my ceiling and I was starting to feel paranoid. I took this strain camping with my family and I was walking around the long road that stretched across the campsite. I was walking down a gravel road and it looked as if everything was a video game. I felt happy and tired but at the same time I felt like I was up for an adventure.  This strain is very nostalgic for me and I would smoke t again. But not all the time. Just enough to enjoy the bright colors on my SNES or to go for a walk and feel like Iâ€™m living a video game.,4,trainwreck,0.023111111111111103,0.4625555555555556,True,False,False,0.269984928,0.0025924685076923076,0.11678488635383022,0.5992245035188551,0.526391838905593,158,False,0.7202396771219489,0.08951574137025314,False,True,depression,True

2616,DocBravo,"Ok, I'm a relatively new smoker, so take that into consideration when reading this post... It's probably not a good idea to smoke anything named after a catastrophe for the 2nd strain you've ever tried (That was my bad). I tried trainwreck twice. The first time it donkey kicked me in the chest, singed my torso follicles, riddled me with famine,  and put me to bed... all in the span of 15 mins!  (...4 hours later) I awoke with a full head buzz and a desire to consume things that have been in my pantry since I moved in 3 years ago.  After the first &quot;Train Ride&quot; I figured it was safe to give it another go about a week later (This was Saturday)... I wouldn't feel safe for the next 2 days... The buzz this time was IMMEDIATE! I barely had time to put away my water pipe, before the &quot;Train left the Station&quot; ....destination: THE SUNKEN PLACE! That's the only way to really describe the next 3 hours. Straight out of the Movie &quot;Get Out&quot;, I proceeded to get nauseous, and retract into my own body (minus the tea stirring spoon). It was as if time stood still. Seconds felt like minutes, minutes like hours! I could see my life happening in front of me, but I was simply a spectator.  Everything I wanted to do took extreme effort and concentration. After riding in the car with my Wifey, we came home after about 45 (which felt like 45 hours), and I laid down for about 2 hours. Though I felt a little better, the nausea was still noticeable,  but I was able to eat.  I woke up Sunday a little sluggish, with nausea, but still a little better.  What really suprised me was I still felt high on Monday, 2 days later!  Lesson Learned: Don't expect something called &quot;TrainWreck&quot; to feature Thomas the Tank Engine... be prepared for Ozzie Osborne's &quot;Crazy Train!&quot; ",1,trainwreck,0.10635337752525253,0.39840345418470413,True,False,False,0.269984928,0.0025924685076923076,0.11678488635383022,0.5992245035188551,0.526391838905593,158,False,0.7202396771219489,0.08951574137025314,False,True,eye_pressure,True
2617,Kimberley,"The first time I tried this, it really hit me...hard. I am glad I was smart enough to take a hit...wait, another hit...wait &amp; so on. At about four hits I stopped. In retrospect, I should have stopped at two. Never the less,  I felt confused...yet creative, I made the most inspired floral arrangement. Then I made the mistake of sitting down. I felt as if I had melded together with the sofa. I think I did because, I had 3 hrs. to get everything in order &amp; get ready to go out for the evening. The next time I looked at the clock I only had an hour left to get everything done! Had it not been such an important evening, I would have been content to stay conjoined to the couch.  This strain could go either way depending on your mood...creative &amp; energetic or a complete crash &amp; burn or should I say burn &amp; crash?  A little goes a looong way. The only real negative that I have for this strain is that with an extended repeat use of Trainwreck, I tend to feel more edgy &amp; the potential threat of a panic attack feels as if it is looming in the wings. This strain I like to reserve for pain or insomnia. It isn't one of my favorites as it doesn't give me that warm, lovey, comforting feeling that I like.

It is a very nice strain with mostly sativa type effects, happy, euphoric, relaxed yet not to the point of making you unmotivated. If anything, it actually motivates you and it's great for daytime use. This is a perfect strain for depression, anxiety, stress, motivation and creativity. The buds are nice and dense and have a very nice fruity smell and taste with a very smooth smoke. Grow; Indoors: She can be finished in 7-8 weeks. - Outdoors: It's an excellent and a great choice if you live in a cooler area where plants need to finish earlier and you still want something with strong sativa effects. At 42*N latitude she started flowering the last week of July and was ready around the third week of September, contrary to Leafly's estimate. - Very easy to grow both indoors and out. Plants have a distinct sativa leaf that is very narrow and grow in the typical pine tree look. The best thing about this strain is it's sativa dominance in effect and look, yet it has the Afghan gene that will make her finish very fast for a sativa, with very little stretching once flowering is induced. Has a high leaf to bud ratio in volume but not by weight as there are a lot of leaves to trim but most are very small and narrow. Strain seemed very stable with little variation between phenotypes.

2655,doobwalker,"AK-47.   The name conjures images of Rambo mowing down redneck republicans while screaming &quot;they drew first blood, sarge!&quot; Fortunately, while AK-47 certainly has the power of its namesake, you won't be experiencing Sly Stallone dripping sweat all over you.    A good balanced hybrid, I would judge this about an even 50/50 between the sativa and indica effects.   The head space is good- mellow, pleasant but motivated.  The body effects are just enough to be there- killing your pain, but not your motivations.  Taste is actually rather complex- skunk and floral notes compete with a curious earthiness at the back of your throat while a sweet sensation covers your tongue as the thick smoke curls and expands.  Speaking of that smoke... this is a cougher.  After repeated use, I noticed a pronounced harshness/menthol feeling at the back of the throat.  Maybe this was because I had shatter than flower... but it was unpleasant enough that a beverage is a required accessory when medicating.  Didn't stop me though, and I even went back for a second batch.  That says something.  Not stellar, but a very good everyday &quot;go-to&quot; that does what it should.  All in all, a very pleasant and well balanced hybrid that effectively riddles your pain and stress with a barrage of semi-automatic bullets... without leaving you bleeding out in the dirt from a sucking chest wound.

2656,jack123,"Great bud.... Very indica heavy. I smoked about 2.5g with a friend (we both use it for pain, so we usually smoke together). After smoking you feel dizzy, but that goes away in like 2 minutes. After that you feel like you are wearing a very tight hat. Your temples feel like they have something pushing on them. It feels pretty nice. This goes away after 10-15 minutes. Most of my peak period was spent eating and drinking because I had some dry mouth and hunger. This isn't a very social strain. Its a nice strain for burning by yourself to some music. Manages pain and stress very well. I would give this a 7 because its strong for a while, but about 60 minutes after smoking it totally goes away leaving you with a &quot;hung over&quot; feeling. This carried on for hours and kinda sucked. I would reccomend rolling joints with 2/3 of this, and 1/3 sativa dominant strain (see blue dream, green crack, etc). This takes some of the laziness and hang over away. Without this sativa its very easy to crash because this is GREAT for insomnia. Congrats to anyone who has made it to the end of this.....

Otherwise this strain gets me into finding mistakes or oddities in shows that I would not pick up on when I wasn't using. It's a relaxing, ever-so-slightly energizing high.

People came by and I wasn't especially talkative, so I wouldn't take it to socialize.

No anxiety, no nausea or panic attacks or insomnia, speech problems, vision problems, lethargy or worsening of my OCD which I get with every Indica I smoke. I love AK because it makes me feel really good and like I can actually go out and see things. My boyfriend and I first tried this in Amsterdam and practically bought the whole of Amsterdam's worth to sit and smoke throughout the visit.

2693,lukem99,"This strain would earn a 5/5 were it not for the abysmal come down, but other than that, it's simply a piece of magic sent from heaven.   On the first hit, you know that this is sent from the heavens. I have a pretty high tolerance, but the first hit let me know that I was in for a special experience. It starts off with an overwhelmingly strong and stimulating cerebral buzz that quickly spreads to the rest of the body. After smoking about half the blunt, I was on another planet. My mind was racing with thoughts and memories, and every inch of my body was tingling. Sensations were intensified, it was slightly windy outside but every gust of wind washed over me in warm, comforting waves of euphoria. At this point, the head buzz had calmed a bit, but was still very intense. Nature, its sounds and sights were overwhelmingly serene and peaceful. I was totally at peace, as if nothing could harm me. After finishing the blunt, I of course sparked up another one and was shot into another universe. Moving inside, I turned on some music and cranked the volume, leaned back in a comfortable seat and closed my eyes. The music took over. It was breathtaking, one of the most wonderful experiences I've ever had. The euphoria was very strong, encompassing my head with a serene happiness and washing over every inch of my body. I felt heavy and glued to the seat, as if I couldn't move and I never wanted to. Did I mention the music? It sent me into worlds of my own thought and memory, lost in blissful joy. The intensity of this strain was simply unbelievable. After the peak ended after about 45 minutes, I was still very noticeably high for well over two hours. A subtle head high remained while the body effects tapered down to where I was easily productive, but still high.   The come down, however, was a horrible experience. I can't really blame this on the strain as it could just be my own personal experience, but I felt I should mention it. I had very intense pressure behind the eyes and had a pretty bad depressive episode. I have these fairly regularly, it's one of the reasons I smoke, but never had I experienced one this bad while on the come down from a very happy, euphoric strain (my favorite kind). Like I said, this could just be me but I felt it deserved mentioning.

Beware though, this bud will take you too another planet if you aren't careful, at this point, as with most strains, you will lose the focused and energetic effect and enter a more psychoactive and &quot;couch-locked&quot; state (which is very fun I might add).

2787,highlyscientific,"Pleasant, gentle puff. Not at all like a barrage of bullets. No coughing. Smooth. Mild mannered on the tongue. 2 hits for Martini61. Calamity Jane (or Annie-Got-Her-AK-47) took three. She will henceforth be referred to as CJ. Old Man Blathers is also making a cameo in this review.  â€œHow would you describe the high?â€ù asked Martini61.  CJ fans her fingers in front of her face, peeping from behind. 1, 2, 3 fingers wave before her eyes.  â€œOoooh,â€ù says Martini61. â€œShy but playful finger moving and cute eye widening.â€ù  CJ is slammed. The other two seem to be having a more gradual ascent. OMB saw it more as an approach rather than an ascent.  Martini61: happy, giggling, gentle high.  CJ: (a series of facial expressions, from the happy to the confused to the  bilateral)  Creativity MIGHT be good; but implementation, verbalization, and delivery of service - a term that makes CJ barf in her mind - are all way down. So is creativity increase? Does creativity exist in that realm?  Philosophical thought inclined; but, once again, implementation and verbalization is way down.   Conversation is impaired. We are certainly under the impression that we are saying things to each other and we know well enough to wait while others were talking. But there is no rhyme nor reason. 20 minutes later, we prolonged period of coherent communication. Communication revived.  Down a level. OMB says heâ€™s more stoned whereas before he was more high.   Stoned: Increased eyelid weight.  High: Racing brain.  Indica vs. Sativa, we discovered.    Martini61 is desperate to know if sheâ€™s the only one - and Calamity Jane - who donâ€™t know the difference between high and stoned. So Old Man Blathers reaches out for a lineline: He texts college friend Dave Useda, who replied, â€œScadush...vs. Vienna Boysâ€™ Choir going, â€˜Aaaaaaah!â€™â€ù  When asked to define â€˜scadush,â€™ Useda replies, â€œSca...dush...slo mo crashing into bed.â€ù",4,ak-47,0.1795378151260504,0.5445518207282912,True,False,False,0.265630488209571,0.0031178346287128785,0.5851923872386064,0.5121400730426562,0.7381432227411099,156,True,0.29280397421723936,0.10086743490526857,True,False,pain,True
